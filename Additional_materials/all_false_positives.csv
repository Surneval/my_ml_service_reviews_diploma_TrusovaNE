5,the basic formula for the original series was take someone get the audience to like them then put them into mortal danger this formula worked for the 32 episodes made between 196468 now we jump forward 40 years to 2004 we are introduced to alan tracy a somewhat lessthandiligent college school kid with his friend fermat a young knowitall they are whisked off by lady penelope in her pink ford thunderbird to the island paradise where the tracy family live for the school holidays almost immediately they are left in the care of kyrano and his daughter tintin whilst the adults go to rescue john from thunderbird 5 which has been damaged by a staged accident this is all part of the hoods scheme to take over tracy island so that he can steal the thunderbird machines to rob a bankyes the plot is as limp as thatthe dialogue is banal the acting more wooden than that of the fibreglass puppets the effects anything but special and hans zimmers score what little there was of barry grays glorious theme shone through zimmers lackluster orchestration the rest of the score was eminently forgettable in fact part of the score was broadcast the following week on the radio and didnt recognise it i didnt even bother to stay to witness busteds mediocre efforts with the end titlesto be fair ron cook worked quite well as parker he and sophia myles as penelope seemed wasted with the right material they could have been show stoppers the cgi work was what i would have called leading edge 5 years agothe dynamics of the main craft were just wrong the original series models at least moved as if they had massanother sore point is that the whole production seemed to be one long set of product placements from every vehicle being built by ford to the entire content of the tracy freezer being produced by ben jerrysmy son 9 enjoyed the film but this cross between spy kids and clockstoppers aimed squarely at his age group added nothing to the thunderbirds legend when star trek hit the big screen in 1979 with the motion picture a whole new lease of life was breathed into the franchise which then continued for another 20 years or so with this film frakes has missed a golden opportunity to do the same with the thunderbirds franchisei predict that this film like the avengers and the saint before it will sink into obscurity within 6 months leaving the original series to its classic status,1,0
50,when this play was first shown by the bbc over 30 years ago it would have been something quite different for the time so therefor some people would have found it quite scary and may well have been impressed with the special effectslooking at the play in this day and age it doesnt seem to be all that scary anymore even the special effects can leave a lot to be desiredwould a train really be allowed to pass a red light into a dark tunnel i dont think sobut if you watch this play again you will observe that the first train that enters the tunnel rushes straight through the red light maybe thats how it was in dickens timeyou will also notice that the footpath that leads down to the signal box is very steep and in a poor state surely there would have been a series of proper steps with handrails for the signalman to climb up or down into the cutting i cant help but notice things like thati will not take anything away from the acting both denholm elliott signalman and bernard lloyd the traveller gave wonderful performancesi am not at all sure what is going oni mean was the ghost the traveller or what does anyone really fully understand this rather confusing story well maybe i am the only one that dontto sum upthe play has a wonderful atmosphere throughout with great character it suffers from not being that scary these days and a little if not very confusing in places and has some rather unusual signalling practisesthanks for reading my review,1,0
53,i never intended to see venom but i caught it on cable it does have good elements the louisiana swamp atmosphere for one something we will unfortunately not see so much of in movies because of hurricane katrina it is based on an interesting concept a regular man imbued with the spirits of evil his confrontation with his son could have been interesting as could much of the movie but as tends to happen in hollywood an interesting idea goes down a familiar direction kill off all the characters save the good girl starting with the black guys im a fan of agnes bruckner but the other characters the villains aforementioned son cece who must become a voodoo priestess are more interesting and for the love of god just once i would like to see the virgin get killed we all like the easy girl why cant she live in this case it was bijou phillips and we love herthe ending made no sense considering what had been established about the villains invincibility all the carnage and atmosphere and it leads to nothing,1,0
57,firstly this is not an adaptation of a stephen king book short story novella or anything else from ews web site and their review on the show when it first aired he never writes down to his audience and he never betrays contempt for his subjects his first original work for television stephen kings golden years cbs july 16 911 pm is no exceptionthe series was apparently going to be as others have mentioned an ongoing series which is why we never saw the ending after the cliffhanger they left us on but this was never quite made clear to the viewers who were left wondering how it all endswhen the series came out on videotape it touted itself as having the neverbeforeseen ending it should have said the shouldneverbeseen ending spoiler the very ending was the only significant part changed for the video though parts of the whole were left out and that changed ending was what destroyed the story for example rather than our two intrepid fbi agents realizing that they were now labeled as bad guys and on the run from the evil jude anderson of the shop as originally broadcast jude simply walks up to them and they shoot him bang dead and no real emotion to speak of in the scene ditto on the bit with harlan and his wife going poof whereas the original ending left us with a spectacular cliffhanger on the video they simply get out of the cockadoodie car end spoiler it was a sad ending to a rather well made miniseries and makes the video completely not worth buying or even renting sincerely save your money and your time,1,0
62,i havent seen it in over twenty years oj was the bus driver arte johnson was the tour guide lorenzo was the kidnapperyea lorenzo looked very much at home as the villain a natural i think i watched it back then most for oj who i had seen towering inferno and cassandra crossing but also to see arte johnsoni was a little bored that johnson was so seriousand yes it shifted plots in reading other posts i remember that was some plot that they were going to kidnap some rich girl but then that priceless stamp business turned up out of the bluei was going a stamp if it came on as a late movie i would probably record it to check it out again but i wouldnt be nostalgic over it not yet anywaythere are better movies from the seventies like this to check out,1,0
74,my god what an incredible movie it is reminded me so much of the similar scene in mel gibsons movie we were soldiers when the company is not lost theyre just cut off and the other scene in pearl harbour when the british officer says to ben affleck if all americans are like you then god help the nation that goes to war with americaput all 3 movies together and you would have enough bullshit to fertilise the entire sahara desertthe story of the cutoff battalion may be real enough but the movie could have done without all that american preachy jingoistic propaganda attached to it there were audible groans in the cinema during the abovementioned scene in pearl harbour no kidding either the lost battalion however is really in a class of its own americans think they are unbeatable inspired bravery i actually cringed and damn near puked at all the swill being spewed out throughout this diarrhoeic disaster the movie that is the fighting scenes were well made 3 stars for that but if the script is manure then wrapped even in brightly coloured ribbons it is still manure the writer james carabatsos also wrote those other screamers hamburger hill no mercy heartbreak ridge someone please shoot him before he writes any more such garbagethe director russell mulcahy is an australian too god the shame,1,0
91,in film i feel as though it should be more than just art i think it should be more than that a way to tell a story on screen this short from david lynch tells a story but not much of one i felt that it was funny but too bizarre to be a comedy it is good filmmaking but there really isnt anything else to it as ive said before i am a huge david lynch fan but i get frustrated by some of his work because i dont see a need for it at all this is definitely my least favorite thing he has done so far but i know hes still got a ton of talent and i am excited to see what he has in store for us in the future if you like lynch check this out but dont be surprised when you dont like it very much,1,0
92,the ballad of the sad caf worked hard at its image but when it came down to crunchtime it was left standing in its own selfcreated dustone cannot image saying this out loud but if vanessa redgraves amelia were to fight john wayne or even clint eastwood my hardearned dollars would have to go to redgrave her portrayal of amelia was as close to perfection and consumed with more detailed dedication than most actors are willing to give to any multimillion dollar contracted persona redgrave gave amelia this soulful drawl that was a blend of her own unique voice and a hardearned woman from the south to the average viewer this could be construed as annoying but as the film progressed it became her miss amelia transforming this stage beauty into a roughneck it was redgraves performance as well as her interaction with the other characters that made this film stand tall but not the tallest the others following her performance were needed but not stellar as we moved past the murky clich image passed on by every set designer hired for the postdepression south job the minor characters felt like poster board the image was needed to set the scene but the characters of the town had no other purpose take for example rod steigers vision of some old wild spoken preacher his scenes alone will make any viewer question the validity of this offthebeatenpath town the main two players who surrounded amelia battled with charm for the admirable top scenestealing moment but due to the lacking direction it just seemed faded the most absurd of the two albeit both rank high among the questionable sanity line is cork hubbard who plays amelias cousin who shows up randomly one night his character is never quite defined he lacks true motive and his loyalties remain uncertain he plays no vital role in this film outside of forcing us the viewers to question his sanity and honesty can you create a character simply by sticking out your tongue flicking your ears and punching your chest and head finally there is the other end of the absurd keith carradine callows closeups of this tormented man build character but our lack of understanding between him and amelia causes his purpose to flounder these were the characters as clich southern as they were some stood forward and attempted to create an absurdist period piece and i cannot argue that they failedwhere ballad of the sad caf failed to rise above mediocrity was in the cinematography and narrative this film was about amelia and her need for other souls in her life the audiences level of comfort with the arrival of her midget cousin was entertaining one couldnt help but wonder if he was honest or merely a confidence man attempt to leech off a warm heart cork hubbards character is never quite understood but we do accept him with brief shots of him and amelia doing small things together it is his idea that transforms from a recluse businesswoman to a bonafide caf owner the problem is that director callow never quite takes us to that dramatic take level between cork and redgrave is the man crazy or does he represent all of amelias family i needed something from callow that brought these two out of the david lynchesquire relationship that they had then our pool gets even deeper with the addition of carradine as amelias love interest using the technique of a flashback within a flashback we see the two wed but never consummate their love which amelias anger against their love drawing him into the world of madness why was amelia so angry why was there no connection between carradine and redgrave why was this even in the film with the lack of focus towards these characterss connection the eventual scenes between the two made no sense throw in corks choice and it just gets completely discombobulated while there were a few beautiful choreographed scenes that callow created the inability to transfer his characters from point a to point b i lost focus interest and my care for the characters plummeted when i didnt understand the ultimate question why overall the ballad of the sad caf began with a bang but ended with a very small crack of a firecracker my emotional feel of this film swung up and down up and down and eventually stayed further down mainly due to the lack of understanding of the motives of the characters redgrave did a phenomenal job as amelia and while the other characters outside of the random steiger tried their best i just didnt quite understand who they were their motives were so muddled that when the emotional ending finally occurred i was apathetic director callow seemed to have been lacking importing connecting scenes that would allow us to understand the dynamic relationship between all of our main players callow created some beautiful scenes where faces seemed to overlap the scenery which allowed us to focus on amelia or carradine but nothing was explained or developed the film played out with anger discover happiness flashback anger anger anger fade out without the comparative connectors this transformed from distinguished period film to actors playing parts in front of camera it was a shame because sad caf had the promise it just couldnt delivergrade out of,1,0
112,actually this is a lie shrek 3d was actually the first 3d animated movie i bought it on dvd about 3 years ago didnt bugs life also do that i think it was at disneyworld in that tree so im saying before they go and use that as there logo also shrek 3d was a motion simulator at universal studios they should still consider it as a movie because it appeared in a theater and you could buy it for dvd the movie was cute at least the little flyes were i liked iq i agree with animaster they did a god job out of making a movie out of something that is just a outandback adventure i recommend it to families and kids,1,0
127,the first official release of world wrestling entertainments film division is a pretty basic horrorslasher movie called see no evil starring kane one of their big men wrestlers known for having an intimidating presence hardhitting moves and one of the most convoluted backstories in wrestling and lets not pull any punches here while this movie is promoted as the greatest horror movie of all time mostly by wwe it goes without saying that after having seen this movie i can confirm it as one of the greatest comedies of all timesee no evil sees a bunch of juvenile delinquents sent to a hotel so they can clean up of course a monstrous murderer played by kane also happens to be living in this hotel and we all know where that goes without giving away too much of the movie plot this film has all the semblance and structure of an early1980s slasher flick with most of the clichs intact but without any of the scares that those films accompany and thats sort of the main problem with see no evil it tries so many of the tricks implied by its predecessors in the genre that it comes off as predictable veteran horror fans will easily recognize some of the gimmicks ahead of time and even those who have only seen a few flicks should tell what happens next its too generic to be scarythe movies gory no doubt but its only there for the effect the dark atmosphere instilled in the movie gives off that feel of terror initially but as you get towards the end it somehow feels out of place and gets tiresome quickly the death scenes dont come off as gory and horrific as much as they do laughable although some of them are pretty inventiveand the acting in this movie is pretty bad too as the main characters arent developed enough for us to care when they eventually do get axed some cant even portray fear properly they just scream and cry in a vain effort to emote so when they die it only adds to the comedy because you dont care enough about them that you simply consider them the equivalent of starfleet redshirts to the monster kaneas for kane he simply portrayed his movie character the same way he portrays his wrestling character only he uses axes and hooks instead of hellfire and brimstone theres no doubt in my mind that kane can be a great fixture in the horror genre he has the look and presence for it he just needs better material specifically a script that isnt written by someone who writes wrestling shows to work withnow despite what may seem like a harsh review i actually enjoyed the film its one of those laughably bad movies that you cant help but sit down and enjoy my main gripe with the film again is that its simply an exercise in filming gory kills and doesnt have any frightening or shock moments i enjoyed it but i enjoyed because it was easy for me to laugh off some of what was supposed to be scary moments in the movie if that happens because it was supposed to be that way the movie would have been rated higher but it didnt it got laughs because its a bmovie and it doesnt help that the directors previous experiences was porn flicks and music videos not exactly overcomplicated things to direct anyway nonetheless i enjoyed it tremendouslyif you dont mind a fun bmovie or funny horror film id highly recommend see no evil if you are a true enthusiast of the genre id wait until the dvd comes out before checking it out everyone else should probably go watch something else,1,0
143,the main portion of this lightweight musical story is located at fictional midwick college which peter kendricks peter lind hayes attends due to the largesse of stage actress grace hayes his reallife mother who fills the same role here and who manages to supply his love interest through her secretary mary healy who is his reallife wife drably directed from a weak script and additionally hampered by excessive cutting and poor editing this film does provide some treasures among its eight songs including the title number and has nice turns by soprano healy benny rubin as a snack shop proprietor and the dynamic tap dancing roland dupree,1,0
144,the operative rule in the making of this film seems to have been never make a 1 minute scene when you can make it a 10 minute scene this was a principle set right from the start with an interminably long portrayal of the graduation of the harvard class of 1870 the point of that scene i suppose was to introduce some of the primary figures in the story and give a bit of their background which is somewhat effective when comparing the idealism of the harvard graduation ceremony to the realism of life in johnson county wyoming but it just keeps going and going and that sets the stage for a film that features repeated stretches of mindnumbing nothingness made even worse by the fact that i found a significant amount of the dialogue to be almost incoherent in the end i couldnt even watch this in one sitting i got through about half of it and had to set it aside for a couple of days before i could drag myself back to see how it turned outmy reaction to this movie in many ways is a shame because there are positives here the performances are generally of a high calibre especially from kris kristofersson as averill christopher walken as champion and isabelle huppert as ella the basic story interspersed as it is around that everpresent mindnumbing nothingness is potentially interesting focusing on the efforts of immigrants to establish themselves in johnson county and a local cattle companys efforts to stop them by killing a number of them in collaboration with the government and the military theres also some absolutely breathtaking scenery shots having said that the whole thing could frankly have been done in half the time and should have been in the end all those potential positives are washed out by again the mindnumbing nothingness that the movie seems to revolve around seriously 210,1,0

227,i happened upon this flick on a rainy sunday intending to tunein to something else out of curiosity i accessed the comments here and found myself watching it to the end i really didnt do so with intent this was one of those movies where youre fascinated and watch it for another couple of minutes until you finally just watch to the end and the indictment of it in most of these comments made it more fascinating to view the one comment where the person really liked it seems to be solely as a result of liking ladd and spano and their earlier roles but great isnt anywhere to be found anywhere here story performances and particularly the absurd courtroom hijinks we all know that perry mason before raymond burr passed the 300lb mark and ben matlock are granted some leeway in cavorting around the courtroom instead of being boringly confined to a lectern and matlock is especially granted the privilege of entering exhibits often by simply going to the jury and showing them before the judge and prosecutor have even been informed of or shown them no reallife judge or prosecutor would stand for thisboth perry and ben almost always ended the proceedings by wringing a confession of the real killer actually perry nearly always did this but often matlock would simply present overwhelming evidence of the true culprit pronounce it reasonable doubt and then leave it to the cops and prosecutors to proceed against the guilty party sometimes oncamera sometimes presumed at the end of the showbut that said holland taylors histrionics and the amount of leeway afforded her in the courtroom portion of this story made the actions of matlockmason moreclosely resemble the slow often boring detail such as seen on court tv and in reallife courtroomsevery character in this presentation was either insipid unsympathetic obnoxious boring improbable or some combination of two or more of thesethe ending was the most banal absurd even silly conclusion possible but again fascinating because of this ladd and spano are attractive individuals and tv movies would appear their best forte probably best in 2ndlead probably better if 3rd roles even in this venue taylor could be cast as the aunt or mother of one of them give this one 1 star for the storyperformances and 3 additional for the fascination factor,1,0
232,i dont usually write a comment when there are so many others but this time i feel i have to i have spoken of taste in another review saying its all in the eye of the beholder but when it comes to this film if you like it it simply means you have bad tastei love films i loved isle of the dead which is pretty much an unknown bw film i even liked scream and scary movie i liked these films because they have if not a lot at least something good about them i appreciate 999 of the films ive seen because they tell a story which i havent heard before and most directors only make films with a good storyline throughout this film i was thinking where is this going even near the end where did they get these awful actors from was that supposed to be a joke and suchlike with the obvious twist looming i was sceptical but hoped it would perhaps make the film and prove i hadnt wasted my time i was sadly mistaken the storyline was bad to begin with and the twist actually ruined any glimmer of hope there was heres a rundown storyline much like the first film which was alright this one is slow and sparse with no audience relation to the characters or the situations the situations are cringeworthy and shallow and completely boring and predictable the twist was terrible it didnt make me feel a thing like excitement or wow just my god there was nothing in the bulk of the film that you could look back to and think oooo wasnt that clever because it wasnt in fight club there are flashbacks at the end showing bits where tylers true identity was cryptically shown and when you watched it again you saw more it really was a work of genius how it was written laid out and directed this was a meaningless attempt at an awesome twist i think it was wild things that had like a pretty poor double twist and i still liked the film because the rest was ok and it wasnt trying too hard to be a big twist its like the ci2 writer thought it was gonna be the best twist ever but really its just a bad story with a bad twist dumped on the end the film ended almost immediately afterward with the whole film void by sebastians whole story build up meaning nothing and a horrible half forced paedophilic ending with a particularly young and innocent acting girl acting the actors in this film are appalling almost as bad a sunset beach extremely corny and badly performed its not even so bad its good like hunk the worst acting i thought came from amy adams who played kathryn it was a rigid pathetic and badly thought out performance by her robin dunne was also poor i havent seen american psycho ii yet but no doubt his laid back cool style has ruined that film alsoi cant even say it is a good film for teens as its not if my son or daughter liked this film id be ashamed but they wouldnt anyway as they would take into consideration all the things that make a good film which this film has none of really im disappointed that some have said you might not be in the age bracket for this film and so dislike it i like all the films now that i liked as a teen and had very good taste also do you really think that when you reach 20 you suddenly dont like any teenish story lines no i liked mean girls and other generic teen films and watch beverly hills 90210 all the time theres no excuse for poor directing acting and screenplay im afraid besides i was 1617 when i first watched it if anything being older just makes you a better judge of a terrible film i cant believe anyone can give it 1010 either one of my favourite films is memento and i gave it 9 as i know there can be better it is a shame for this site that people do that give 10s flippantly or dont get the filmsshow and so give it 2anyone who liked this film really should vary their taste and perhaps their lives and with this realise that this is the worst film ever made worse than loch nessif you arent a teenager with bad taste or simply dont have bad taste you will absolutely hate this film,1,0

304,having watched this after receiving the dvd for christmas 2005 i came here to pan it but after reading the other comments i havent the heart clearly this is a film that has worked very well for children of a certain age well let me not be a complete grinch it might still work for some children if they are not too mediasaturated and have not become visually oversophisticated eg from watching all of lotr and harry potter but if you are an adult stay miles away you will not enjoy itthe good bits barbara kellerman as the witch especially in her early scenes with edmund creates just the right blend of charismatic evil and restrained madness at the stone table she goes a bit over the top michael aldridge in the minor role of the professor and jeffrey s perry as mr tumnus also have the kind of polished skillful acting wed expect from the very best bbc dramas and the aslan costume works very well amazingly well considering they got the eyes just rightthe bad bits almost everything else but two areas in particular one the casting england is crammed with good actors and contains tens of thousands of attractive british school kids how could they possibly have ended up with these four stiffs they move like wooden soldiers and speak about as well peter has no gravitas or charisma and is visibly shorter than his supposedly younger siblings edmund is just whiny and lucy sophie wilcox as lucy is so dramatically visibly drastically wrong for this part that i cant imagine how she got the jobtwo the animal costumes again it appears that they worked for some kids if the kids are still at a level where big bird and elmo are exciting believable characters they might be entranced by this film but to a viewer with the sophistication of say a 12yearold whos seen prisoner of azkaban when mister beaver comes out from behind that tree there will be hoots of cruel derisive laughter the costumes just do not work i could not and i think any adult or modern teen could not suspend disbelief when looking at mister beaver the drawn animation later gryphons etc works better is easier to takeso ten stars for the very young and tender of soul everyone else read or reread the book and watch the far better film that unrolls in your imagination,1,0

319,edwin porters 1903 short film entitled the great train robbery bursts onto the screen with so much excitement and ingenuity that one prepares to be blown away by another pioneering early film just like melies a trip to the moon critics have hailed this as being the film that introduced the western genre into modern cinema in my eyes they were right it had everything from the planning the actual heist of the train the murder of an unwanted civilian and that looming final scene that makes you realize that these villains mean business it was all monumental for its time from here to eastwood every western filmmaker has used porters image in some form or another to create their own story one cannot say that this film didnt open the door but the struggle comes from the story itself the genre was defined by porter but outside of its initial excitement there really isnt anything to grapple onto perhaps i am jaded by the clich modern westerns and their haphazard messages but how can something be clich before being clich to me the great train robbery seemed forced untraceable and unsurprisingunlike melies porter tells a very linear story robbers change the course of a train rob it then shoot at random people just to prove they are the true villains and the final scene ends like any predestined film without any surprises or glitches and that looming man with a gun to your proverbial face it is bland porters film is boring in the edition i watched there was an addition of color near to the end to emphasize emotion which felt cheap and was not encouraging to the filmmaker or to the viewer the issue remains that while it is important porters film has been borrowed time and time again it has in effect become diluted the story itself does not carry the emotional powerhouse it once has unlike melies early film i cannot watch this again i know what has happened i know there is very little missing from behind the scenes and that finally it is just what it has set out to be a simple story leading from point a to point b to point c this issue is not only my gripe with this film but also the strongest element to see in such an early film while it was dull the fact that it told such a strong narrative that our characters were characters with motives and drives was outstanding to see in an era where nonfiction films seemed mainstream this broke the mold again not that i am jumping on the prophetic bandwagon about this film it is an important film it just isnt a great filmoverall i was eager to jump into this film to see where the roots of the western genre were planted but i was equally as happy to leave this film behind porter is a talented director and gm anderson obviously went on to be very successful in the created field but i just wasnt in awe of the film i wasnt expecting big budget effects like melies work nor was i expecting a duplicate of a trip to the moon but i did want to see the same creativity exploration and originality i felt porter played it safe if that can be said with such an early film but i couldnt feel the excitement as our villains did their evil deeds i wasnt rooting for anyone and the final conclusion proved that the kitschyness of it had worn off minutes after the film started it was pioneering but not monumental the great train robbery has lost its space in the time capsule of cinemagrade out of,1,0
367,paul armstrong is a liberal scottishborn professor of law at harvard known for his passionate opposition to the death penalty who is hired to take on the case of bobby earl a young black man from florida who has been convicted of the rape and murder of joanie shriver an eleven year old white girl earl claims that his confession to the crime was obtained under duress by a sadistic police officer and that the real murderer is blair sullivan a serial killer already under sentence of death for several other murders armstrong visits sullivan in his cell on death row hoping to persuade him to confess to joanies murder thereby saving earl from the electric chair at first all goes well sullivan confesses and earl is released from prison when the appeal court quashes his conviction as this development takes place only a little after halfway through the film it is at this point that alarm bells will start ringing in the mind of the viewer warning major plot twist ahead and so it proves the anticipated twist soon materialises earl it transpires is actually guilty of the crime of which he has just been acquitted and probably of several others as well but hatched a diabolical plan together with sullivan in order to secure his freedom sullivan will confess to joanies murder if earl will murder his parents just why sullivan wanted his parents dead is never precisely explained armstrong now finds that he is himself in danger from the man whose life he has just saved earl has a grudge against armstrongs wife herself a lawyer who acted as counsel for the prosecution in an earlier case when earl was accused of rape just cause is an example of the autocannibalism in which hollywood sometimes likes to indulge cobbling together one film by recycling themes and plot devices from a number of others the first half owes an obvious debt to films like intruder in the dust and to kill a mockingbird about the only difference is that the sheriff who beats a confession out of bobby earl is himself black whereas in earlier films he would have been white police brutality is now an equal opportunities activity the central twist in the plot was borrowed from costagavrass music box although in that film the revelation does not occur until the very end the finale in which a lawyer his wife and their young daughter are in danger from a former client is an obvious plagiarism of the two versions of cape fear which also take place in the swamplands of the american south ed harris characterisation of sullivan as a biblequoting religious maniac is a direct imitation of robert de niros character in the scorsese version of cape fear made four years before just cause there is a postscript just as just cause borrowed heavily from several other movies seven years later its central plot twist was in its turn to be blatantly plagiarised in the ashley judd vehicle high crimes the trouble with this style of filmmakingbynumbers is that the resulting films are generally much less distinguished than those which inspired them the whole is normally very much less than the sum of the parts and just cause is a much lesser film than any of those which were cannibalised to make it harris is normally a gifted actor but this is one of his weakest performances largely because he is not so much playing a character as playing de niro playing max cady blair underwood is ok as bobby earl the supposedly innocent young man of the early scenes but unconvincing as bobby earl the murderous psychopath of the later ones sean connery as armstrong and laurence fishburne as the black sheriff are rather better but neither is good enough to save the film connery and harris were to act together in another better film the rock the following year there is another problem with just cause the first half of the film looks like a standard liberal issue movie antideath penalty antiracist and critical of heavyhanded policing the second half looks more like the work of a diehard reactionary preaching the message that all criminals are evil bastards that the only way to deal with them is to fry them in the chair that liberal lawyers are the useful idiots of the criminal fraternity and that police officers who beat up suspects are to be commended as heroes the filmmakers seem to have been blissfully unaware that the plot twist casually introduced into the middle of their film had the presumably unwanted effect of reversing its political stance or if they were aware of the problem they ignored it a suitably convoluted plot was obviously thought to be more important than political consistency 410,1,0
382,i really liked this movie number 5 the star robot of the movie gets hit by lightning and some thing happened to his circuits he act and thinks more like a humanthe robot repeats commercials he learns after watching tv he then applies these sayings to his circumstances number 5 is quick witted and funny the character imitates voices of stars tries to dance like john travolta in staying alive and a lot of other things he has a saying for most of his circumstances that he memorized the actions of the robots is really good number 5 wants to drive cook and please stefany with all the characteristics of a human the way the robots move and line up is really hystericali am disappointed that the writers could not keep this clean for all viewers this movie has a surpris ending something you would not expect i hate movies that have swearing in them even though i like them i give them a lower rating this movie had swearing words jesus christ was used as swearing word which offends me it is used a least 3 times gd dm bull sht etc it could have been a wonderful movie with out all this offensive language there is no sex in this film some violence like robots blowing up cars and machines,1,0
407,john candy need we say more he is the main reason you should see this film most people dont realize how gifted he was as an actor witness him changing from poor slob to horny jerk just a simplesubtle facial change and off we go there are many great bits in this movie and many really dumb bits the best moments for me are the kung fu u scenes as well as the great moment when johnin a trance goes up on stage and talks about how much he loves his girlfriendthat is how much he and his genitals love his girlfriend im sure reading this you might think this sequence sounds really crude it is but it is also very funny mainly because it is john candy doing this bit the story in general is pretty lame and eugene levy and joe flahertyboth sctv alumni with candy are not given enough to do in the film levy has his moments especially filming the wedding at the endthink rod serling and the great scene when he is talking to his mother on the phone overall a good movie if you have had a tough day and need to put your brain on stupid i give this one 4 out of 10,1,0
409,i must say that i wasnt impressed at all probably because i was expecting much more from this movie maybe an accent on religion vs science or on the meaning of life not just a few lines so if you expect something to think about after you see this movie dont its more psychological than philosophical i vote 4 because of the end it clears up a bit and because i have a great respect for bbc documentaries there are a couple of very interesting scenes that actually gave some sense it was a brilliant idea to add it in a movie related to theory of evolution too bad that this wasnt the main subject ah i just forgot to say that for more than 1 hour the movie is quite boring and in a way cruel,1,0

413,within the realm of science fiction two particular themes consistently elicit interest were initially explored in the literature of a precinematic era and have since been periodically revisited by filmmakers and writers alike with varying degrees of success the first theme that of time travel has held an unwavering fascination for fans of film as well as the written word most recently on the screen with yet another version of the hg wells classic the time machine the second theme which also manages to hold audiences in thrall is that of invisibility which sparks the imagination with its seemingly endless and myriad possibilities and this theme too has again become the basis for a film adapted from another hg wells classic the invisible man the realization of which here is hollow man directed by paul verhoeven and starring kevin bacon and elisabeth shuesebastian caine bacon and his colleagues have for some time been conducting experiments for the us government exploring the possibility and practicality of invisibility which they have at last achieved in a number of the primates upon which they have tested their method they have in fact progressed to the point that effecting the invisibility is assured their only problem now is bringing the subject back to the original visual state of being its a problem however that caine after diligent effort and too many hours in the lab has solved or so he thinks and when the application of his theory on a live subject is successful he decides to present the results to the board of directors in an effort to thereby maintain the funding necessary for the continuation of the projectat the last minute though caine demurs fearing that control of the project will be wrested from him before they can proceed to the next level the testing of a human subject and he takes it upon himself to become that subject securing the assistance of his research team by telling them that theyve been given approval by the board to do so but something goes wrong and caine becomes trapped in his cloak of invisibility and as he and his team struggle to find the solution to his considerable dilemma before its too late it all begins to take a toll on caines mind and suddenly his fear of losing funding and control becomes inconsequential as he finds himself facing the imminent danger of losing much more than that now theres a very real chance that he may lose everything including himselfverhoeven has crafted what is initially an exciting even thought provoking film he establishes a good pace and uses the fx at his disposal to great effect though he does tend to allow the striking visuals to overwhelm the character development anyone familiar with the invisible man or actually anyone who can logically follow the progression of the story will know early on that caine is not destined for happier times still verhoeven has a style of storytelling that is definitely going to capture the attention and engage his audience but he seems bent on rushing toward the climax and along the way he abandons any and all of the nuance that has made his film thus far successful opting to enter into a final sequence that is nothing more than a mindless bloodandgore fest that betrays his audience and everything hes worked for earlier in the film rather than seeking an intelligent resolution to caines suffering and using some inventiveness and imagination to take the film to its inevitable conclusion verhoeven takes the low road and though it may succeed on a purely visceral level any meaning one could derive from the story dissolves like so many ashes in the wind along with anything that would have made this a memorable film and its a shame because verhoeven has it at a higher level than much of what is offered in this genre and he allows it to sink unnecessarily to one much lowerkevin bacon does a good job of creating a character that is believable if only on the surface which seemingly serves verhoevens purposes perfectly theres little depth to bacons portrayal but it has more to do with his directors agenda than his own acting abilities verhoeven simply does not allow bacon the time to develop caine to any extent the character is mainly a vessel around which verhoeven can build his story and toward that end it works the film would have been better served however had verhoeven and bacon collaborated more closely on at least developing a bond between caine and the audience that would have prompted some emotional involvement on the viewers part something that would have drawn them in a bit rather than leaving them at the gate as it were as mere observers of an fx laden extravaganzaelisabeth shue comports herself well in the role of linda mckay caines willing accomplice in the illfated experiment but its basically a thankless part that offers little challenge especially to an actor of shues caliber the same can be said of kim dickens so magnificent in the 2001 film things behind the sun her character sarah kennedy does little more than support the action and fx both actors are capable of so much more and deserve better than what they are given to work with herethe supporting cast includes josh brolin matthew greg grunberg carter joey slotnick frank mary randle janice and william devane dr kramer entertaining to a point and even successful on a certain low level hollow man is one of those films that leaves you contemplating what could have been like an annual fireworks display it will give you some momentary thrills but after awhile itll begin to blend in with all the others youve seen without anything special to set it apart and its too bad because given the talent and abilities of those involved here it could have been so much more i rate this one

418,way back when the xfiles was an intelligent thoughtprovoking show a big part of its appeal was that the writers looked to folklore and science for their ideas tying the plot to the spooky side of real lifei was incredibly wary of the 8th season when it aired the show had already provided two perfectly good episodes to bow out on one son and requiem and the 7th season had seen a sharp rise in episodes that scraped the barrel for ideas that were farfetched implausible or downright silly but i figured hey give it the benefit of a doubt maybe theyre bringing it back because theyve got some great ideas lined uproadrunners really was upsetting following patience which at least offered an interesting angle on the vampire folklore that the show had done well to avoid the episode sees a strange alien parasitic slug with the power of mind control worshipped by a cult of backwoods christians oh and they think its the second coming of christ but you only find that out in the last couple of minutes seriously theres never any attempt to make sense of this to explain what the slug is why anything thats happening is happening or anything even in the shows early years in fact especially then you could expect a little bit more depth a bit of background or if not that then the opposite a bit of mystery some uncertainty about what this was all about its scully that really kills it though you could put up with the silliness of the premise but to have a character who has been developed over a good 7 years as a rational skeptic transformed into a gullible maverick purely for the sake of advancing the plot is bizarre to watch you feel like youre watching some godawful teen horror except that its a woman well into her thirties throwing herself into the kind of creepy isolated community that shes spent the best part of a decade uncovering the sinister underbelly of being either outwitted by very stereotypical hicks or utterly indifferent to her own safety oh and by the way doggett the new mudler isnt around scully just wandered off into the desert to look into a brutal murder on her own without him he shows up at the end to save the day i cant even remember why but apart from that hes not really in it again seriouslyin short it feels like either a generic script written for another show or someones pet movie project which theyve been allowed to shove like a mutant leech into the spine of an existing longrunning show at a time when it was at its most vulnerable it mightve worked on a lesser show where the characters are more archetypal and the audience expects less but the xfiles had a good thing going and scully was one of the strongest and most idiosyncratic tv characters of the 90s deciding that youre going to change her personality for the sake of a story that they mustve done on star trek a good fifty or so times is pointless,1,0

494,i have nothing at all against paul schrader in fact hardcore 1979 is one of my very favorite films but some horror movie fans were in a premature uproar when his original version of the exorcist prequel dominion this one youre reading about right now as it turns out was scrapped by warners and when renny harlin was substituted to spruce things up and make a new version that was more scary in my opinion some viewers were prejudiced and became automatically juiced up for hating renny harlins take on the subject exorcist the beginning before the first frame of film was ever even unspooled for them to judge and i ought to know because i myself went into the theatrical premiere of beginning with stubborn arms folded and prepared for the absolute worst which i was sure had to come imagine my surprise when i found harlins beginning to be much more serious than i ever could have conceived with a good performance from stellan skarsgard as a young version of father merrin who was struggling with his faith in god it wasnt a great film by any means but it was nowhere near the garbage i had prepared myself for well in advance sight unseenwell now i finally have seen the true garbage version and its paul schraders dominion prequel to the exorcist it was relentlessly talky uninteresting and insipid stellan skarsgards troubled priest was nowhere near as interesting as he had been for me in harlins film and the actor himself not as good in the part for all those who pointed out the obvious cgi effects in beginning guess what theyre here in dominion as well remember the silly ending in harlins rendition which ill also agree tainted the rest of that movie well youre going to find that this ending from schrader isnt a hell of a lot less lamelet me also say that i resent the nonsense thats been presented by those who appreciate this film better than harlins by saying that were retards or cannot appreciate subtle filmmaking as a person who despises stephen sommers mtvfashioned mummy of 99 and being a true fan of the very suggestive and discreet old horror films of the 30s and 40s i can assure you this is not the case with me at least there was some degree of terror and exorcisttype goings on in harlins beginning this one here is just a real exercise in tedium and a great challenge even for the most certified of insomniacs its going to be quite interesting to hear horror fans try to convince themselves that dominion prequel to the exorcist was as good as theyd already made their minds up for it to be in advance just as they were already predisposed to lambasting harlins beginning the second they learned paul schraders name was getting soaked with the whiteout,1,0

515,i find it disconcerting that in an era when satisfying and fulfilling spirituality is unknown and we are all scattered across the whole spectrum of possible beliefs that a charlatan and fraud of gurdjieffs caliber as a charlatan he is exceptional there is no denying he had a special gift its a pity he misused it though for the aggrandizement of his wounded ego feeding on the adulation of unwary sheep who were at his beck and call and in awe of him can inspire such extreme adherence and credulity this movie presents an idealized version of gurdjieffs own largely fictional and fantastic account of his formation and awakening which i would rather describe as his discovery of how much he could sway the minds and wills of certain types of sadly disoriented people see it if you dare to have a disagreeable eyeopening about how sadly deprived we are of true religious leaders to the extent that a clown like gurdjieff could inspire such devotion and be careful to have your blood pressure medicine at hand if you are one of those who still hope for a healthy religion to emerge from the ruins of christianity as a supreme example of cinematography at the entire service of the premises and pretenses of a dysfunctional cult,1,0

593,ed gein the butcher of plainfield is set in the small american town of plainfield in wisconsin during 1957 where loner ed gein kane hodder lives by himself on a farm after the death if his mother brother the local police have had a spate of grave robberies to deal with when local barmaid sue layton ceia coley suspicions grow that something nasty is going on ed is a violent sexually deviant man who kidnaps girls murders them will the police figure the truth out in time to save erica adrienne frantz the sheriffs timothy oman daughterwritten produced directed by michael feifer this was an attempt to base a horror film around the true events surrounding notorious serial killer ed gein turns out to be pretty crap the real life ed gein was only ever convicted of two murders died in 1984 but several films have been inspired by him including the texas chainsaw massacre 1974 deranged 1974 ed gein 2000 with this fairly recent addition possibly being the worst gein film ever even though ed gein was real next to nothing in this film is based on fact gein never had an accomplice none of his victims were related to any of the investigating officers there was no car crash victim although gein keeps his name other people have had name changes the kidnapping murder of the two women depicted here actually happened four years apart in reality but in this film it happens over the course of a couple of days while here gein is shown as a large hulking muscular man in reality he was a scrawny thin old quite short as a factual drama ed gein the butcher of plainfield is worthless as pure entertainment its no better with a deadly dull pace feel to it the characters are all boring when he isnt killing someone gein is shown working or just walking around its very dull theres no suspense because we know who the killer is its just a tedious wait until he gets caught at the end there is no real attempt to get into geins mind with the makers giving him no more motivation than him occasionally having hallucinations of his domineering motherthere isnt much gore here theres a scene with a woman hanging on a meathook theres a really badly edited scene of gein cutting a leg off theres the usual jars of bodily organs skulls lying around as well as a bit of blood but theres really not much here to get excited about the film was obviously processed to bleach a lot of the colour out of the picture as its not far off black and white at times i personally think the lack of colour makes it even duller to sit throughwith a supposed budget of about 1500000 i cant really see where the money went in a very forgettable production although set in wisconsin this was filmed in california kane hodder is all wrong for the role of ed gein just from a physical point of view hodder doesnt look even remotely like gein he gives a pretty poor performance to as he just stares at the camera a lot making silly facesed gein the butcher of plainfield is crap its as simple straightforward as that as either a factual drama or pure exploitation entertainment this is total tripe from start to finish with nothing to recommend it,1,0
633,i think it is very interesting this movie is called a thriller it is anything but thrillingmost of the time you hear piano sounds then you hear piano sounds then some people talk about facts which do not concern anybodythen again piano soundsto be honest this movie was the reason for me to register at imdb because i think this movie is one of those which humankind has to be warned ofspoiler by the way the most actionlike part happens when a can of hot chocolate is spilledalso very interesting the actors yes the quotes are intentional as you can think because they do not act they play piano and do smalltalk but its not acting they doi think before this movie i never left a cinema and felt angry really this film made me angry angry for the time and money i spent on it,1,0
664,after seeing the 1996 remake i thought it was the funniest way to see cruella de vil getting her punishment for torturing animals just for their skin the whole movie was quite funny and on my view better than the animated one but there was actually no need for a second one first of all if cruela is returning dont cure her and make her insane again just make her break away from jail and thats a rap i thought it was not very funny its supposed to have only one original puppy returning id expected that it should be lucky since he was the most appealing and besides having roger and anita back too however they decided to have a complete recasting and adding not really one hundred not even one hundred and two but only three puppies and a parrot that thinks hes a dog clever gerard depardieus part was pointless at the end cruella suffers way too much way too humiliating and way too exaggerated to be true she gets baked inside a giant cake that was a desperate attempt of physical humor trying to imitate the same effect from the first one that just didnt work it was too much over the top and not too funny i actually felt sorry about cruella,1,0
681,like its near contemporaries the great race and those magnificent men in their flying machines i always associate this film with my childhood especially at new year on new years day wed visit my granny and after lunch while the adults talked the kids would watch tv where invariably one of these three crazy race films would be onfor that reason alone i really wanted to mark monte carlo or bust well but i fear i cant the child not being father to the man on this occasion by which i mean i can see all too clearly its faults and while i was tempted to smile occasionally in truth i really wanted all the competitors to get to the end of the race long before they actually doof course its dated by its stereotyping of nationalities and woman as the weaker sex and i also didnt much care for one or two stray admittedly mild vulgarities which occasionally surfaced more than that though the cast despite hamming it up outrageously just dont sell the film enough tony curtis in a trial run for his yank abroad turn in the tv series the persuaders seems too old to be playing the young gallant terry thomas just isnt dastardly enough eric sykes is unbelievable as a dirtyminded lothario while gert frobe as an overdone teuton is just weird doing camp comedy when you remember he was bonds best villain goldfinger if anything the englishers come off best susan hampshire is at least engaging as a bright young thing suitably gamine as a posh flapper and although chained to the leash of the script pete and dud offer the most amusement as stiff upper lip army types although even then the carry on team did this so much better in carry on up the khyber passdirector annakin tries everything to evoke the golden silents with lashings of slapstick mistaken identity capers speeded up camera shots wouldbe dramatic stunts and some light romance but theres no real tension for such a famous race and anyway the raceoff at the end seems like another swizzactually id have given it another mark if theyd stuck to the alternative title those magnificent men in their jaunty jalopies but in truth the animated series wacky races did this so much better,1,0
686,a memorable line from a short lived show after viewing the episode where that line was introduced my fraternity intramural flag football team started using the line to break our huddles on offense instead of ready break our quarter back said football and the rest of the squad responded you bet a fun way to break the huddle that had our opponents scratching their heads as very few of them had watched the show using this line added a unique element to our season that ill never forget we had our best season during my time in college that year and in a small way it was due to the fun that we had using this line the show was pretty much a stinker but it lives on in the memories of the 1977 pi kappa phi intramural flag football squad at west virginia tech,1,0

753,the first season was great good mix of the job and the brother and friends at home it was actually a pretty funny shownow it shows up again and the brother and the two hot chicks are gone and the whole thing revolves around the airline company even the old man who runs the company has gone downhill way too over the top where before it was perfectthat and no more sarah mason one of the best looking girls in hollywoodthis is what happens when you let some execs get their hands on a show you can almost see the meeting the old man is funny lets focus on him make him way over the top and make it all about the airline itll be a nutty version of the office anyhow no hot chicks no watch,1,0
774,the brief existence of the sex pistols and the making of this film after the controversial groundbreaking english punk bands breakup both happened before i was born however i started listening to their only album never mind the bs heres the sex pistols in 2003 when i was a teenager and quickly became a big fan i didnt see the great rock n roll swindle until 2006 but saw it a couple times that year and thought it was pretty good certainly not great but pretty good even if i could only remember bits of it and didnt see how it all connected seeing it a third time nearly three years after the second i didnt care much for it at all im not even sure what i found so good about most of it in the first place cant remember nowthis film is a mockumentary in which sex pistols manager malcolm mclaren tells his side of the story of the band and its members guitarist steve jones credited here as the crook drummer paul cook credited as the teamaker bassist sid vicious credited as the gimmick and john lydon aka johnny rotten credited as the collaborator mclaren claims that he created the band and even the genre of punk rock as a scam to make money he tells much of the story to helen wellingtonlloyd aka helen of troy in various places where they go together its basically a hodgepodge of mclaren talking pistols songs live footage of the band fictional scenes often silly strange ones several cartoon sequences etc all put together in one film to tell the pistols managers side of the story in a bizarre wayit has been well proved that mclaren is a liar i know many have already pointed this out including band members themselves he was not the driving force of the band he didnt create them nor did he invent punk rock and the sex pistols werent even the first punk band though they were unique the band members were the ones who made the band what it was the filth and the fury a much more believable film about the band from julien temple who made this film is told from the point of view of the band members who contradict mclarens claims however the dishonesty of the great rock n roll swindle is not my biggest problem with it if it were actually entertaining which i used to think it was to a certain extent i would be able to overlook that like i obviously used to be able to do during my third viewing apart from sex pistols songs some live footage and at least one mildly amusing cartoon sequence it was pretty dull i found the who killed bambi song mildly amusing at first but it got tiring very quicklyis this mockumentary worth watching for sex pistols fans it seems a good number of fans would say it is not to learn about the true story of the shortlived but groundbreaking 70s punk band but for entertainment that was once my opinion on the great rock n roll swindle after the first time i watched it i couldnt remember a thing mclaren said and by the time i saw it the second time i was aware of what the pistols manager was using this film to imply but could still barely remember anything i heard him say obviously other aspects of the film were what i found impressive now after my third viewing i can definitely remember some of the things mclaren says but it still wasnt 100 clear like most of the film i guess his words are not that memorable probably because of the way theyre presented if youre a pistols fan i guess it wouldnt hurt to give swindle a try but to me for the most part its just an incoherent boring mess that tries to be funny but fails,1,0
778,first i liked that movie it seemed to me a nice comedy with some silly moments the costume designer albert wolsky did his best the same as wonderful set decorator robert r benton this man really had a very good taste but the script writers disappointed me extremely the best ending would be the scene on the ladder but instead of it they decided that the father and his daughter should be together dont like the ending the father becomes boyfriend of his own daughter and his exwife knows about it and finds it alright it would be ok if the scriptwriters would for example say that now there is a different soul in the body but they did not they only deprived him of memories the actors were good they were really funny cybill shepherd was charming robert downey jr was very funny in the dancing scene but some of the moments spoil even the impression of good acting for example corinne jeffries played by cybill shepherd after the death of her husband was waiting for him 23 years its a long time she was true to him she loved nobody but him and when she met him and was just about making love to him after a scene with her friend philip train ryan oneal she very easily betrayed the man she was longing for so many years it would be a good movie if not the ending and some missed human psychology,1,0
822,anna kokkinos success with head on now begins to look like it depended totally on the script and alex dimitriades great lead performance the degree to which this latest the book of revelation is both derivative pretentious and utterly unoriginal except for tristan milanis fine cinematography seems to bear this out alas there have already been quite a few aussie movies dealing with such themes some reviled for sexism andor explicit sex scenes in the 1970s and 1980s and beyond and maybe theyre worth looking at again after this piece of fluff of course setting the whole thing in the world of ballet and making it all achingly slow and in its choreography like a 1960s dutch ballet experimental number does suggest great art if youve not traveled around muchand then only if you never progressed beyond art theory 101add to the pretension appallingly arch dialog you will do as we command and the whole shebang falls onto its well funded face then there are the sexy bits straight from dario argentogiven the lovely but truncated performance by colin friels how about a real city primeval thriller all in all with the book of revelation the feminist project has been set back yet another decade and with the willing and deeply imitative of male writers like henry miller william burroughs even bukowski collaboration of some collective in melbourne oz suffering from a form of educational and ideological amnesia no revelations await us here,1,0
837,if another hitler ever arises it will be thanks in part to nonsense like this film which propagates the absurd notion that he was a visibly deranged lunatic from the start far from following such a person and electing him to the highest office in the land sane people would cross the street to avoid him and he would have died in a ditch nameless and unknownanyone who reads the accounts of hitlers close companions the autobiography of his secretary traudl junge for instance will be struck by the fact that people found him a kindly intelligent generous man he was also a brilliant orator and the fact that his speeches seem overblown and ranting to modern ears ignores the times in which they were made when strutting pomposity was common in political speeches ditto the overstated antisemitism which was neither a central plank of the early nazis who were primarily anticommunist nor uncommon or unusual for the times the film makes it look as though hitlers sole ambition from the start was the holocaustif you want to identify the next person who will cause the death of tens of millions you can ignore flecklipped ravers life the one portrayed here look instead for a charming charismatic man whose compelling speeches inspire the entire nation and whose political work visibly and materially benefits the country im afraid his personality will be much more like barack obamas than fred phelpsi hoped for much here and got nothing but caricature the fools who made this thing perpetrated a crime against reality this is the historical equivalent of reefer madness,1,0

905,most of the french films ive seen and enjoyed were more talk than action but thats okay i found them interesting wellphotographed and with intriguing actors however i did at one point wonder if gerald depardieu was in every french film ever made it seemed that waythis movie has the same interesting visuals and had a good opening but then it became talk talk and more talkwhich is fine for a drama but not for a murder mystery after awhile i almost fell asleep watching thisactually the film was more like a play with almost all the scenes played out in one room thus if you love plays you should like thisbut i want a little more bang for a murder story,1,0
916,the movie heart of darkness is an insult to the book by joseph conrad to be quite honest the movie made me want to fall asleep on the other hand the book was definitely extraordinary i feel that the movie left out several key elements and missed some of the main points from the book in addition the actors were boring and lacked originality and enthusiasmthe book while not an adventure story or easy to understand is full of hidden meaning and interesting twists in the plot the book though very confusing and complex is astonishing when you do finally understand it you feel as if you have actually learned something the novella or short story had several key ideas like futility and craziness which the movie left out in addition several key scenes were changed which in return affected the entire plot many of the scenes seemed to be very choppy in the sense that they did not fit together in summary the movie seemed to be a bad interpretation of the book i would only recommend watching this movie if you cannot picture or understand the book but otherwise i would skip this one it was dreadful and in complete disarray if you have never read the book then definitely do not watch the movie because you need the basic information from the book to understand the movie the movie was a horrible spinoff of an outstanding and detailed book,1,0

996,i have seen shallow grave years ago and that was one of those movies i kept in memory for a very long time it was intense from beginning to end and with plenty of sudden twists but all of these made sensei cant tell the same about dead bodies above the title is a subtitle that claims it to be even better than shallow grave this is a big liedead bodies looses strength and gets far less convincing during the movietwo supporting characters for example turn out to be a whole lot less innocent than they first appeared to be that could work as a surprise but it didnt surprise me i could see it coming minutes before and that is a big difference with shallow graveanother thing i have to mention is that characters in this movie often respond not very realistic they behave like that more often when the movie gets to its endi would have found it far more interesting if some of the characters would have stayed completely innocent not knowing what is going on it would have been better for the contrast with for example tommy and his friend who have to carry a huge secret with thembut no for some stupid reason the makers of this movie decided that all characters should show their darkest sides it does not work in a movie like thisthe end felt much like an open end it left me with an unsatisfied feeling i expected a whole lot more of itat first i would have given this movie six stars because it is not entirely a bad movie i liked watching it most of the timebut occasionally i saw some really poor acting and unrealistic scenes and because of the disappointing open end i stick to four stars this time and because it turned out to be a mistake that i have spend my time and money to it unlike shallow grave i will probably forget dead bodies very soon it is just not such a special moviethe makers could have done a far better job with this movie it is a shame that they did not,1,0

1001,saw this movie at a saturday matine with a friend theater was about 70 fullalthough there are quite a few funny lines it is more of a dramasuspense with humor sprinkled on top robin williams gives a decent performance as does laura linney being a daily show fan lewis black is pretty good in this christopher walken gives a good performance also the movie starts out slow and remains that way for about the first thirty minutes then the suspense part kicks in and starts keeping you a little on edge throughout the rest of the movie suspense in a supposed comedy movie i know that i as well as everybody else in the place was struggling a bit with this a character would crack a joke during suspense sequence and you would hear just one or two laughs in the theater in all fairness after the movie was over there was smattering of applause so definitely some people enjoyed this moviei gave this movie a four out of ten because i believe the comedy aspect doesnt work very well in a suspensedrama movie and the actors performances while not bad were just decent again this movie isnt what was advertised,1,0
1026,this grainy film has a cult following and one of those wordofmouth features you just had to see maybe hard to believe but there is a rural community in southwest arkansas fouke that knows the legend is true this tale is told in documentarystyle narrated by vern stierman and filmed in actual locations talking to actual folks involved the legend changes with the telling but during the late 60s and most of the 70s the surrounding area of fouke was visited by a bigfootlike creature that traveled along boggy creek long limbed with three toes and standing over 7 foot tall this hirsute creature periodically caused damage and frightened the bejeebers out of most of the community i personally crossed over the small boggy creek bridge in 1974 and yes the hair on the back of my neck did rise of course it was about 1 am in the rain by the time i arrived in shreveport i was laughing,1,0
1048,the tragedy of the doomed ship titanic has inspired many books and movies the battle between nature and technology always caught mans imagination the latest film concerning this tragedy in the atlantic ocean was written and directed by famous action movie filmmaker james cameron the story of titanic involves two fictional characters leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet from different backgrounds one is a hoboartist the other is an aristocrat and how their love triumphs over societal barriers and the tragedy of a sinking ship that they happen to be onfirst of all although using a historical name this movie had little regard to history the plot was built around two fictional lovers french diamond and treasure hunters the deaths of over a thousand of people on the greatest luxury ship of its time became a mere background many historical facts were simply forgotten where was the radio operator that ignored the iceberg warnings why was there no mention of the ship that was only 5 miles away from the titanic but did not come to the rescue because its captain failed to identify the distress signal omitting these facts is an insult to the tragedy and what was the point of flavoring this historical disaster with fictional cheesy romance when the story is already as sad as it isthe overall plot was rather shallow rich equals greed and corruption poverty equals compassion and heroism it is very ironic to spend 200 million to make a movie about how money corrupts there was absolutely no human side shown in antiheroes it seemed like billy zane was playing a part of the devil casting was also very poor if dicaprio was 2 inches shorter than winslet you could swear she was his babysitter the length of the movie was unnecessarily stretched to over 3 hours first hour and the half was wasted on establishing the relationships between the characters that were known to audience long before they went to theater and the dialogue that was used to do so made it even worse hearing corny pick up lines such as i see you and this is my side of the ship generated more pain than the screams of drowning people also jokes were too abundant and rather lametitanic did involve some moving scenes such as the part when the musicians were playing while the ship was sinking but they were no way near anything original the best thing about this film were its special effects and that is the only thing that truly deserved an awardalthough this film lacked artistical value in overall sense the public could not resist a sentimental story starring romeo dicaprio and so the movie became a success now it is safe to say that the industry will be less hesitant to invest large amounts of money in a single motion picture so it seems that titanic did achieve something after all,1,0
1068,this movie is truly brilliant it ducks through banality to crap at such speed you dont even see good sense and common decency to mankind go whizzing past but it doesnt stop there this movie hits the bottom of the barrel so hard it bounces back to the point of ludicrous comedy behold as kor the beergutted conan wannabe with the overabundance of neck hair struts his stuff swinging his sword like theres no tomorrow and the way he swung it i really am amazed there was a tomorrow for him or at least for his beer gut dont miss this movie its a fantastic romp through idiocy and sheer bloody mindedness and once you have finished watching this one dry the tears of joy or tears of frustration at such an inept attempt at storytelling from your eyes because some stupid f00l gave these people another 5 to make a sequel,1,0
1089,let me start by saying how much i love the tv series despite the tragic nature of a middleaged man seemingly unable to pursue his dreams because of his overbearing manipulative father it was incredibly lighthearted and fun to watch in practice in my opinion it is without doubt one of the greatest british sitcoms of all time the tv series has my 10 out of 10 rating without reservationthis movie spinoff on the other hand is a true tragedy in every sense of the word hardly any of the essence of the tv show is transferred successfully onto film this movie has a very dreary depressing tone that almost moved me to tears on several occasions seeing harold being beaten up in a pub and not in a comical way is not my idea of comedy but is most definitely one reason why fans of the tv series will not like this movie the movie was painfully unfunny except for the scene where albert bathes in the sink and is seen by a neighbourthe romance between harold and zita is completely out of tone and it makes me wonder whether the producers of this movie ever bothered to watch the tv series in the tv series harold always went after respectable girls not strippersalberts reactions to the remarks made against him by harolds girlfriends were absolutely priceless in the tv series in the movie albert says virtually nothing when such an opportunity risesmost movie spinoffs of british sitcoms tend to be quite dull with the notable exception of the on the buses films which in some respects were actually better than the tv series itself but steptoe and son has to rank right at the very bottom of the pile even below george and mildredmy advice skip this one and see the second spinoff steptoe and son ride again instead it has a much lighter tone is more faithful to the tv series and is actually very funny,1,0

1117,this cartoon is not rightlol i totally disagree with a lot of things it portrayed however it ended on a positive note but as for me and mine we will not be viewing this in our household mainly because we fight against stereotypes every day and this cartoon just confirms what most white people feel black people act likethe comment one of the little black girls made on the cartoon was that her boyfriend was so conscious he was white that really offended me thats not something we as black people take lightly conscious is a state of being that black people achieve when they realize their true ability,1,0
1126,mark pirros deathrow gameshow of 1987 is a black comedy that is extremely cheesy in many parts but occasionally very funny nevertheless this movie could certainly have been a lot better the acting is terrible and some extremely cheesy scenes make it hard to watch at times but the concept is funny and it has some hilarious momentsin the near future the year 1991 game shows have changed chuck todean john mc cafferty hosts a game show called live or die in which convicted death row inmates have the chance to play for their lives and for money candidates who fail get executed on the air using many different methods such as guillotines electric chairs and other more bizarre devices of execution followed by applause from the cheering studio audience the show is of course more than controversial and chuck has made lots of enemiesdeathrow gameshow is incredibly cheesy and crappy in many aspects and the acting is terrible but it is without doubt fun in many parts especially if youre a fan of dark humor you havent missed anything if you havent seen it but it is definitely funny and a good time waster 410,1,0

1155,its boggles the mind how this movie was nominated for seven oscars and won one not because its abysmal or because given the collective credentials of the creative team behind it really ought to deserve them but because in every category it was nominated prizzis honor disappoints some would argue that old hollywood pioneer john huston had lost it by this point in his career but i dont buy it only the previous year he signed the superb under the volcano a dark character study set in mexico that ranks among the finest he ever did prizzis honor on the other hand a film loaded with star power good intentions and a decent script proves to be a major letdownthe overall tone and plot of a gangster falling in love with a female hitman prefigures the quirky crimedies that caught hollywood by storm in the early 90s but the script is too convoluted for its own sake the motivations are off and on the whole the story seems unsure of what exactly its trying to be a romantic comedy a crime drama a gangster saga etc jack nicholson doing a brooklyn accent that works perfectly for de niro but sounds unconvincing coming from jack and kathleen turner in the leading roles seem to be in paycheck mode just going through the motions almost sleepwalking their way through some parts anjelica huston on the other hand fares better but her performance is sabotaged by her characters motivations she starts out the victim of her bigot fathers disdain she proves to be supportive to her exhusband then becomes a vindictive bitch that wants his head on a platethe colours of the movie have a washedup quality like it was made in the early 70s and hustons direction is as uninteresting as everything else theres promise behind the story and perhaps in the hands of a director hungry to be recognized it couldve been morphed to something better but whats left looks like a film nobody was really interested in making,1,0
1159,my first review of 2010 is into the blue 2 the reef the story is about two divers played by chris carmack and laura vandervoort who love to explore hidden treasures at a bottom of a local reef one day after a day of exploring they are approached by a couple played by david anders and marsha thomason they tell the young divers that they want to hire them to explore the reef and find a rare artifact about columbus hidden treasure that is reported at the bottom of the reefnext day the four dive to the bottom of the reef and of coarse after a whole day of diving they find nothing a few more days past and the two hired divers found out that they a part of a major deadly plot in which they cant escape otherwise they will be killed they were hired to find two big containers one contains a nuclear reactor and the other contains a corethe movie also has a back story about another person brother of the lead character trying to patch things up with his girlfriend i reckon this part of the story was a waste of time this also includes a very steamy sex scene between the couple which to me is a complete waste and wasnt needed to be shownhowever apart from that this movie does have some good underwater photography and the colors blend in well which is why it receives 4 stars into the blue 2 is a sequel only by name none of the original actors or characters return it has a dumb plot stupid characters and a boring climax,1,0
1175,normally i would have given this movie a 6 it tackles a very important topic and it does it relatively well despite katie wright which is an accomplishment in and of itselfi have no idea if she was actually instructed to play the character like this or is naturally irritating but she did an awesome job at making it impossible for me to care for lexi theres no dimension to her other than how confused helpless and clueless she is and how good she is at whimpering i can understand how a young girl who blames herself for the loss of her friend and whose eating disorder has spiraled out of control would be distraught scared and in pain however wrights entire performance is based on incessant wailing and sniveling the rest being whining i couldnt help but feel this particular girls problem was caused not by the demon that is bulimia but by her not having a backbone i very much doubt thats the point the movie meant to make,1,0

1225,great piece of fiction played as if factual tonight i was looking at the birdman of alcatraz robert stoud was not a model meek prisoner and he was in jail because he was pimping and a customer did not pay up once he got into jail he was so uncontrollable he spent most of his time in solitary confinement or in the prison hospital killed a few people in prison too this movie reminds me of the birdman of alcatraz but even worse robert stroud did write books and he did contribute to society in someway and the boa had some hints of strouds lunacy but this guy henry young who murder in the first is suppose to be about was a a known bank robber who took hostages and beat them up in more then one robbery he wasnt some poor guy who stumbled into a grocery store which just happened to be a post office and took some money this man was a hard core criminal he also killed a person 3 years before he went to alcatraz he killed another person in jail not because of the solitary confinement which ended over a year before the murder the real story of his life would of been more interesting they did not even get the warden thing right you cant be a warden in 3 different prisons at the same time and by all accounts the warden in the movie was a pretty stand up guy as wardens go plus if my math is right the warden played by karl malden in the boa is suppose to be the same warden in this movie oh boy not only that in this movie we are to think poor henry committed suicide and he wrote the word victory not truehe might be alive right now he was sent to springfield where robert stroud was also a medical center prison then walla walla for another murder he committed and then was released and jumped parole in 1972 never to be found maybe he is hanging out with that cb cooper guy who jumped out that airplane in washington state after committing a bank robbery lol now the acting was very good kevin bacon is in that class of actors which include jeff bridges and dennis quaid the vastly underrated actors club gary oldman well they just might of madeup the warden part so he could play it because he was great christian slater still somehow sounds like jack nicholson i am not sure if that is a good thing or not bacons wife kyra sedgwick was in the movie i think just because she is his wife i like her though but not in this flick for some reason i felt this movie when it first came out was suppose to be a special project for kevin bacon i feel he could of taken a person who is truly a victim of the penal system there sure is enough of them and spread some light on their plight other then picking a psychopath to show as a victim,1,0
1230,okthis movie could have been soooo good all generations have been exposed to thunderbirds and have come to love it and this film had some of the features one would look for in a good thunderbirds movie the craft themselves and tracey island were realistically transferred to the big screen whilst still keeping to the designs we fell in love with sophia miles was simply fantastic as lady p and bill paxton whilst not exactly who i envisaged jeff tracey being was solid enoughbut then the adults were taken out of the equation and we were asked to believe 8 year olds could fly 200 tonne machinesits not so much the fact that the movie was centred around the children that made me feel like jonathon frakes was slapping me with a wet fish and laughing at my hard earned money spent on the film it was the fact that alan tracey was so obnoxious in the film and that he seemed to be as able to fly the machines as well as his brotherswho were at least 1920 seriously these are some pretty damn simple machines to use if this is the casethe film didnt seem to know whether it wanted to be serious or farcical it tried to pay homage whilst satirising and it just generally fell flat on its face 310 2 for the machines 1 for lady p,1,0

1240,wow i swear this has never happened to me before i only watched golden temple amazons yesterday and already i havent got the slightest recollection of anything that happened in this film thats how brilliant this movie is i guess by now i only remember being lured into watching it because of the incredibly attractive dvd cover art showing a torrid drawing of a voluptuous amazon preparing her bow to fire at an unspecified target i often get fooled by appealing dvd covers especially jess franco ones and i still havent learned to resist even after literally hundreds of awful experiences oh well after reading the other usercomments some parts of my memory returned although i still suspect to confuse this film with another jess franco masterpiece i watched the day before namely diamonds of the kilimanjaro and yes that one had an awesome dvd cover as wellgolden temple amazons opens with a posse of hot white african amazons i am aware of the contradiction but dont blame me slaughtering the parents of a fragile young girl because they were trespassing the turf with the intention of stealing the golden treasures from the temple several years and hormonal changes later the girl returns to the jungle to get her revenge shes accompanied by a bunch of sleazy adventurers who are less interested in the act of vengeance but wouldnt mind taking some gold back home the rudimentary premise is obviously secondary to all the showcasing of ravishing female nudity and gratuitous sleaze anala ivars eva lon and the other nameless amazons are all regular franco choices and willingly walk around with their breasts proudly exposed you better enjoy gazing at all these perfect female curves as the rest of golden temple amazons is a boring and incompetent mess theres hardly any violence or action and no less than half of the film is pure filler bits and pieces of national geographic documentaries edited into the story and that sort of stuff the awesome dvd cover would definitely be a great addition to your collection but opening the box is utter pointless,1,0

1325,i saw this film shortly after watching moonlight valentino with elizabeth perkins gwyneth platrow whoopi goldberg and kathleen turner there are a lot of similarities between the two films they both have great casts and good acting they both have stock characters of sisters who are very different an offensive stepmother a woman friendconfidant an emotionally unavailable father a dead mother and a surprise lover both films have the characters experience lifechanging realizations and both films suffer from a kind of love conquers all sentimentality they both add a little titillation with cameron diaz in black underwear and a partial back shot of gwyneth paltrow nakedboth films seem contrived as if the writers of the works the films are based on did market research and said ok theres a market for stories about relationships between women so im going to write about two sisters with an offensive stepmother in other words instead of the drama emerging from the truth of the relationship the relationship is invented to fit the dramatic situation it seems forced the characters dont seem real the relationships are unbelievablethe resolution of the tensions between the characters is simplistic with simple apologies completely whisking away years of acrimony leaving everyone feeling warm and fuzzy ever after its just not real romantic fantasythe characters in in her shoes are a little more overblown than moonlight valentino especially the stepmother part sydelle feller is so evil that it is difficult to believe that the father would stay with her or even marry her in the first placeif you liked moonlight valentino you will probably like in her shoes as well enjoyable performances in both in fact the actors bring depth to their parts that goes way beyond the contrived sentimentality of the scripts,1,0

1366,i suggest if you have already seen the original american graffiti do not see this movie if you havent seen the original i still dont recommend this but it will be a lot less painful to watch the characters from the first film are great and by the end you fell a connection to them this movie sets out to show how bad their lives have become its a chore to watchset on new years eve in 1964 65 66 and 67 we have four stories about the characters from the first film in 64 we have john milner paul le mat who is now a professional drag racer he meets a foreign girl eva and though his plot really goes nowhere its the best of the four in 1965 we have toad charles martin smith who is stuck in vietnam and more than anything he wants out he tries to find ways to hurt himself or do stupid things to get out in 66 we have debbie candy clark the girl who toad picked up in the first movie now she is a pot smoking hippie and really im not sure what her plot was about it was her going to a concertnot much of anything happened finally in 1967 steve bolander ron howard and laurie bolander cindy williams are having marriage problems that end in a antiwar rally and police actionnone of these stories are very good the script in some parts features very very bad dialogue these poor characters who i enjoyed so much in the first film ended up where they are herewhy why was this sequel made i guess if a sequel was made it had to feature the vietnam war and hippies and police action but the real thing is that this movie shouldnt have been madethe direction was stylish but it just amounts in a huge headache each story has a different style milners is just a regular depending on how you watch it wide screen and is filmed how the rest of the movie should be toads plot was shot in 16mm and what it amounts to is a poor looking picture which is the size of a small box in the middle of the screen debbies plot is shot in multiscreen at one point there might have been one screen but for the good majority its anywhere from two to twenty screens up at once dont bother trying to follow the screens since theres nothing going on anyways steve and lauries plot has the weirdest filming style its style really doesnt mean anything and is dumb and pointless instead of just a full widescreen its a condensed widescreen that looks like a full screen version of widescreen though i dont like the others at least i understand what they were going for this one just doesnt make sensethe music is this movies saving grace not that it could save this bob dylan simon and grafunkel stevie wonder marvin gaye and dozens of others have nice songs featured here they dont save the feature they just make it a little better than it is its still bad overall this is a pointless sequel any fan of the original should avoid this lackluster sequel my rating 12 out of 110 mins pg for language drug use and violence,1,0
1367,ninteen eightyfour is a film about a futuristic society in which the government controls everything and no one can be trusted it is a very dark film and it is one that will not make you feel good about yourself it is about a romance taking place in this society and the betrayal of the lovers and about human nature being selfcentred the film has some very good ideas and is done well in portraying this society with the dark tones in colours contrasting with happiness and bright colours in the dreams and a general feeling of loneliness through objects and people and places however despite the films cleverness at portraying this idea the film was very slow and did not seem to quite get the idea across it seemed to spend too much time being clever rather than telling a story,1,0

1402,although this movie is inaccurate overall there are some items that may be true certainly he was a wild character in his youth having played practical jokes on his fellow cadets at west point almost expelled several times graduating last in his class of 34 and often reckless in his leadership during the civil warbut history may have made him a scape goat of the indian wars certainly he did his share of cruel things but how much was he under orders also there is evidence that he testified before congress at great risk to his commission and command that he argued about the fairness of breaking treaties with the indians and that if he was an indian he would also fight rather than live on a reservation as a character said in the play 1776 when asked what will be said about the british about losing the revolutionary war the character states history will do what it always doesit will lie who knows how bad a man custer was certainly he wasnt the sympathetic character as portrayed by errol flynn and later by ronald reagan but i also doubt he was completely evil as he is later portrayed,1,0
1416,recap something mysteriously dense that transmits radio signals is discovered in the ice of antarctica the mysterious block is dug out and brought to a research station on antarctica julian rome a former setiworker is brought in to decipher the message problem is that one of the researchers is a old girlfriend of his and the situation quickly turns awkward especially since the other female researchers practically throw themselves at him and the block of ice with the thing inside is melting unnaturally quickly soon the object is in the open the mystery continues though as the object generates a huge amount of electricity it is decided to open the object but just before that is done julian decodes the signal do not open but too late and the object explodes as it is finally breached and two things unleashed on earth the first is an alien that had been dormant in the object and the other is a virus that instantly kills the research staff and washington that is suspiciously updated on this historic event decides that those things can not be unleashed upon the earth so a russian nuclear submarine carrying nuclear weapons is sent to antarcticacomments the movie holds a few surprises one is carl lewis who surprisingly puts in a good acting performance and the other is that the special effects that are beautiful well worked through and a lot better than expected unfortunately the story holds a lot of surprises of its own and this time not in a good way actually it is so full of plot holes that sometimes the movies seem to consist of almost randomly connected scenes it is never really explained why washington know so much why washington is able to command russian submarines why the object is in the antarctic and has woken up now it is really puzzling that the alien pod is transmitting in understandable english some might want to explain this with that the alien had been to earth before and knew the language and obviously chose english why but then it is very confusing why the nice aliens that apparently want to save the earth from the virus send their do not open message encoded and finally the end is as open as an end can bethe movie is a little entertaining but too much energy from me must be diverted to fill in the voids in the plot therefore the total impression of the movie is not too good310,1,0
1417,obviously i didnt care for things to come aka the shape of things to come as much as most viewers that means that there is a good chance that youll enjoy it more than i did at any rate you might find it useful to hear the film described from another point of viewdirected by william cameron menzies who had as much experience as a production designer and even more as an art director this is a film adaptation by hg wells of his own novel by the same name in my eyes it helps demonstrate why a great novelist may not necessarily turn out to be a great screenwriterthe film opens in 1940 in a londonlike everytown war is brewing and the citizens of everytown are worried that it might reach them it does and it turns into a decadeslong affair that basically destroys civilization wells and menzies keep jumping forward in time to show us different scenes related to the war and its aftermath we see two pilots one downed coming to terms with the consequences of their fighting we meet a postapocalyptic community ruled over by a wouldbe warlord we meet a man from a burgeoning futuristic society we see the way that technology is changing and finally were taken to the full realization of that futuristic society circa 2036 where the leaders are debating the merits of sending man to the moonthat might all sound potentially very exciting but it just does not work as a film structurally the film is far too episodic with little to dramatically tie it together by the third segment i completely lost interest in trying to keep track of the characters i had barely been able to sort them out in the first couple segments theres a constant parade of new faces we dont get to learn anything about any of themit doesnt help that the individual segments with a couple exceptions tend to be awkwardly directed and edited they are also occasionally manipulativeit can almost begin to feel like a propaganda film but maybe contradictorily the segments are also a bit cold and dry emotionallyin fact one overlong section is more like a music videoindustrial promotional video if features shots of building the futuristic city with lots of large machinery lots of welding and so on at one point a guy who looks like an astronaut waves at the camera through some kind of futuristic glass the music for this section is somewhere between militaristic and an overblown horror score i cant say that things to come consists of engaging material in terms of dramabut the common cry in support of things to come is that it is a film about ideas that may be true but there are a couple problems with it if looked at that way one it still doesnt make it work as a film that is as a visual and aural dramatic artwork and two there are far too many ideas presented herethe principle idea is that of war and what it does to civilizations thats a fine thing to make a film about its also remarkably prescient of world war ii as the things to come was scripted and filmed in 1935 released in 1936 wells has some interesting things to say about war some of which go against the usual interpretation of the film for example the ending seems to suggest that another war is breaking out or will at any moment the overall message seems a trifle pessimistic wells seems to be showing that war is simply a part of human nature that cannot be excised although it doesnt preclude progressin fact maybe it fuels progress at least indirectlythat would certainly be enough for one film however there are many more ideas here the scene between the two pilots is one of the more poignant scenes of the film it deals with a complex dilemma one pilot has shot the other down but is now coming to assist him but the pilot who was shot down was carrying a poisonous gas that is now billowing across the field they cant both breathe the gas without harm a girl comes along they only have two functioning gasmasks between them the pilot who was shot down offers his mask as he says hes dying anyway what to do its not that this scene itself could be stretched out to feature length but the ideasthe bizarre complex of both helping and trying to hurt each other in the midst of a warare enough to build a film onanother example during the scenes featuring the wouldbe warlord in the postapocalyptic environment there is a nasty contagious disease called the wandering sickness going around it turns victims into something like drunken zombies the usual procedure is to shoot victims on site in an attempt to stave off the disease this material is dealt with as if it were an afterthought its a great idea and deserved its own filmsimilarly wells presents the future society as having controversial socialist ideas that was enough for its own film too its just impossible to effectively deal with so much stuff in 100 minutes especially when its supposed to be the crux of the film in lieu of dramatic attractionstill there are reasons to give things to come at least one viewing if youre at all a scifi buff this is a historically important film given menzies background the production and set designs are interesting even if the cinematography seems extremely dated its also interesting to see how wells was either prescient or retrospectively humorous in his predictions i particularly enjoyed the means of propulsion to the moon which was strongly reminiscent of george mlis 1902 a trip to the moon aka le voyage dans la lune just dont expect too much from things to come,1,0
1421,though frank loessers songs are some of the finest that broadway has to offer theyre bollixed by joseph l mankiewicz lethargic staging and uninspired presentationwhen its over it barely feels like youve watched a musical mankiewicz doesnt seem to know how to present loessers challenging but tuneful melodies for maximum effect for example one of the best numbers the showstopping adelaides lament concludes by having adelaide vivian blaine belt out the finale while sitting on a chaise lounge and stubby kayes fauxspiritual sit down youre rockin the boat has his backing choir sitting in folding chairs while he simply stands there mankiewicz zaps all the fun out of everything by letting static scenes go on too long and his dialogue adapted from abe burrows stage book has none of the wit that his films like all about eve have part of the blame has to go to the leads just about all of whom are miscast marlon brando looks bewildered as to why hes in a musical frank sinatra plays way too nice a guy and has none of the edge which makes him so essential the songs are not tailored to his style and jean simmons barely registers the way a shirley jones might only blaine as the lovelorn showgirl adelaide commands our attention like a broadway pro should the colorful art direction is by joseph wright and howard bristol created the flashy sets,1,0

1449,bloodsuckers has the potential to be a somewhat decent movie the concept of military types tracking down and battling vampires in space is one with some potential in the cheesier realm of things even the idea of the universe being full of various different breeds of vampire all with different attributes many of which the characters have yet to find out about is kind of cool as well as to how most of the life in the galaxy outside of earth is vampire im not sure how the makers meant for that to work given the nature of vampires who the hell they are meant to be feeding on if almost everyone is a vampire i dont know as it is the movie comes across a low budget mix of fireflyserenity and vampires movies with a dash of aliensthe action parts of the movie are pretty average and derivative particularly of serenity but passable they are reasonably well executed and there is enough gore for a vampire flick including some of the comical bloodspurting variety there is a lot of character stuff most of which is tedious coming from conflicts between characters who mostly seem like whiny immature arseholes primarily cowboy dude and asian woman there are a few character scenes that actually kind of work and the actors dont play it too badly but it mostly slows things down a nice try at fleshing the characters out but people dont watch a movie called bloodsuckers for character development and drama the acting is actually okay michael ironside hams it up and is as fun to watch as ever and at least of a couple of the women are hot the space sfx arent too bad for what is clearly a low budget work the story is again pretty average and derivative but as i said the world created has a little bit of potential the way things are set up bloodsuckers really does seem like the pilot for a tv series character dynamics introduced the world introduced but not explored etc the film does have a some highlights and head scratching moments the kind of stuff that actually makes these dodgy productions watchable the scene where our heroes interrogate a talking sock puppet chestburster type creature hilarious the sex scene wtf indeed the credit and michael ironside as muco the most annoying aspect of it all though is the really awful and usually inappropriate pop music they have playing very loud over half the scenes of the movie it is painful to listen to and only detracts from what is only average at bestbasically an okay watch is youre up for something cheesy even if it is just for the chestburster scene,1,0
1488,the first review i saw of this on imdb says that vince vaughn is a much better actor than anthony perkins was in this role makes me wonder if he saw the original its tough to review psycho if you dont have the perspective of how revolutionary the movie was in 1960 you have a heroine who isnt very likable and is killed not far into the movie and a villain who is creepy but makes you feel for him add to that some graphic violence and you have a blue print for some of the slasher films of the 80s and 90swhere does this film go wrong lets start with casting anne heche is fine as a vivian crane but as norman bates vince vaughn is all wrong for one thing he looks far too young secondly he has no idea how to play the roll his nervous laugh reminds me of ron howard trying to play a tough guy on happy days everything he does screams i did it the original movie even to those who know everything about it still makes you feel uneasy about the influence of mother on norman and turns her into a real separate character how about the shower scene when i finally saw the 1960 movie on a big screen i was surprised at its power to scare the heck out of me bernard herrmans score becomes incredibly shrill and loud and goes further toward scaring you than danny elfmans synth interpretations during the scene this shower scene merely serves to show us anne heches naked body and some nice color blood which brings us to the choice to film in color didnt workthere is something about remaking classic films that hardly ever seems to work some may see this as a noble experiment but honestly if gus van sant had nothing to add to this film he should have left it alone,1,0

1649,anthony perkins and sophia loren are absolutely gorgeous in this ca 1840 western that alone however doesnt help a ridiculous story with countless historically incorrect elementsbyrl ives is convincing as the 70something tyrannical patriarch an egomaniac who swears to see his 100th birthday his wild dancing at a party he gives for his neighbors will make anyone take notice this guy is sevety six always mumbling bible verses he demands respect while driving sons and friends away with his selfrighteous rantings and emotional crueltiesthe love affair between perkins and loren at first appears absurd but becomes believable near the end there is plenty of drama but not enough to feel good about clearly written for the stage this story was dated even when it was filmed perkins whistles my bonnie in the 1840s although the song wasnt composed until 1882critics knocking sophia lorens command of the english language are rather petty i found her english flawless and completely audible as a neapolitan loren speaks a distinct dialect that often had to be dubbed into proper italian her accent however hardly affects how she speaks english as a first generation german american i can appreciate the efforts of those who learn english as a second or even third or fourth languagedesire under the elms is a drama or even a tragedy in the classic sense for my enjoyment is was missing a logical story and an overall pay off for the time invested fans of the stars wont want to miss it others however tune in at your own risk,1,0
1674,if youve ever been harassed on the underground by a christian who says jesus is the answer whats the question then perhaps you should thank god if youve never met a lacanian slavoj zizek the most evangelical of lacanians would surely exchange the word jesus in that statement for lacanhegelzizeks star burns brightly at the moment no doubt because we generally view films and pop culture purely as entertainment for our consumption so it seems impressive when someone anyone comes along and says hang on films may say something about ourselvesthe ideas zizek expounds in this film are true purely because he says so for example zizek explains that three marx bros are the ego superego and id god knows what happened to zeppo or gummo perhaps theyre the sinthomeor is that movies themselves this is simply what they are in zizeks output culture is not there to be investigated but merely to be held as an example of his ideology people may object that he certainly has something to say but how different is what he says from the christian attributing everything to gods willwhats wrong with taking examples from films or anywhere to illustrate theory well nothing at all as zizek seems to believe they may even serve as a proof however it is merely cant and propaganda when these examples are isolated from their context without context you can say and prove anything you want for zizek lacan is the answer so he goes and makes an example of it everything but everything resembles the teachings of the master and culture is there to bear this out to serve this ideology for instance zizeks exemplar of the fantasy position of the voyeur is taken from a scene in vertigo when jimmy stewart spies on kim novak in a flower shop but in the context of the film this is not a voyeurs fantasy position at all stewart has been deliberately led there by novak this presentation of examples isolated from their context continues throughout zizeks two hour and a half cinematic sermonhis analysis of the baby wants to f scene in blue velvet is laughable touching lightly on what he appears to consider to be the horrific to the masculine truth of feminine jouissance zizek says that isabella rossilinis character not only demands her degradation but is unconsciously in charge of the situation this is an example of her jouissance well possibly but sorry to be prosaic where is the evidence for this in the film she partially undergoes her humiliations because hopper has kidnapped her son zizek may object that she also evidently enjoys rough sex with kyle maclachalan but this may be due to any number of things isnt that the point of socalled feminine jouissance according to lacan feminine jouissance unlike phallic jouissance cannot be articulated it is beyond the phallic capture and castration of language if this is right then no example can be made of it it also means that the entire concept is nonsensical and entirely mystical it can only be designated by dogmatists such as zizek theres feminine jouissance for you why is this feminine jouissance because i say so what example can really be garnered from these films only zizeks psychology why does he keep inserting himself into his favourite films even to the point that when in a boat on botega bay he says he wants to f rod steiger too is this not the wishfulfilment of someone who spends his life critiquing films as the saying goes freud would have a field day with the perverts guide to the cinema but with zizek himself nobody elsezizeks theory that films show us how we desire may be right on the face of it but these films cannot be strict universal examples of psychoanalytical laws this film illustrates how zizek desires and only extremely vaguely as to be almost useless how the rest of us desire for as any psychoanalyst knows how we desire and what we desire cannot be fully separated and cannot be easily universalised if at all zizeks love of making everything an example of lacans answer bears this out how do we desire like this this is how i do it problem is in zizeks desire everything and everyone else is rationalised into his desire but zizek is a leninist and they certainly dont like letting the subject speak for itselfthe perverts guide to the cinema is a summation zizeks love of dogma and is entirely unphilosophical even if it remains very political what dogma isnt zizek has never questioned exactly what his motives might be when embarking on an analysis what he is trying to discover because the terms of his exploration and therefore his ethics in doing so are never put into questionzizek is extremely prolific but all his books and this film say the same thing hes a kind of henry ford of cultural theory massproduction and any colour as long as its black he is perfect for todays highly consumerist society supposedly critical while giving people the same cap over and over and pretending that it is something different this is popular because people largely prefer readymade answers to their problems which capitalism always claims to provide rather than investigating things with any serious consideration at all which is kind of like being brain dead for me zizeks third matrix pill is a suicide capsuleps i loved zizeks solemn remark presented as a revelation about cinema and humanity that music in films can greatly affect peoples sympathies did this only occur to zizek after he watched jaws,1,0
1677,when jim wynorski first announced he would be doing a new sequel for my favorite series of all time the slumber party massacre series i was ecstatic i had been waiting for a new installment for literally years so production began and very small bits and pieces on the shoot and the actors involved were released until the shoot wrapped then the announcement of a title change no longer would this new sequel be titled slumber party massacre iv but cheerleader massacre instead i was a bit disappointed but having a different title would be a very small price to pay for a film i had waited so long to happen i was still extremely intrigued and on the edge of my seat to see itmaybe a month ago some very advanced copies of the film were released to some extremely lucky viewers who got to see the film months before its release date a few reviews leaked on the net and judging by them i began to become apprehensive on jim wynorskis cheerleader massacretonight i got to see the film for the first time in full length and i am still scratching my head as i read in another review cheerleader massacre is definitely not a new installment in the slumber party massacre series but a slasher flick all on its own and a bad one at thatbefore i get into the specifics of the film let me first state what an enormous fan of jim wynorskis films i am i always thought him to be a true camp genius with a winner almost every time yes his movies are made on shoestring budgets and dont contain the most topnotch acting around but theyre fun nonetheless they are what they are campy movies you watch when you want to have a good time from sorority house massacre ii to hard to die to chopping mall jim has produced the goods on more than one occasion one of the reasons why i was excited that this film would be his latest projectcheerleader massacre does not in my opinion reflect any of the films i had seen this directorwriter create in the past firstly the production was extremely inexpensive and the film was actually shot on videotape something i had never seen jim do before the actors were mediocre to say the least and the story is almost laughable the killer is also extremely stupid and reminds you more of your cuddly old grandpa rather than an escaped lunaticof course the film is littered with female nudity this is a jim wynorski movie were talking about folks but some of the boobshots seen here almost seem like they were done for time there is an extremely long shower scene containing the cheerleading coach that seems to go on forever and it greatly reflects a shower scene in jims sorority house massacre ii the girl even bathes herself almost in the exact same waycheerleader massacre is also extremely cliched to say the least the opening scene is literally something weve all seen in hundreds of past slasher flicks a guy and a girl making out on the verge of consummating their relationship whenyou guessed it theyre hacked to piecesbrinke stevens who ive never really considered to be a tremendous actress in the first place also gives one of her stiffest and forced performances in her small cameo were talkin possible cue cards here she recalls some incidents her character endured by the killer seen here twenty years ago to the police while footage of the original slumber party massacre plays why was footage from the original film used if it was definitely not a new spm i have no idea there is also two explosions seen in this movie that i am almost certain were recycled from other filmsnot only does this film recycle footage from past films but it also recycles the scores from other films as well some of the music used in humanoids from the deep which was also recycled prior for the coroner can be heard throughout the entire film there are at least two more as well that i cannot identify but am certain have been used beforeafter sitting through this films horrendous acting ridiculous story nonexistent gorespecial effects and camcorderlike quality i am having some serious concerns toward mister wynorskis career has the man who delighted audiences with films in the past finally lost his niche only time will tell oh and lets not forget his newest film a new installment in the sorority house massacre films now titled final exam i think im seeing a pattern here,1,0

1759,1st watched 12262008 direugene levy corny comedy murder mystery with very few laughs the movie appears to be based on an earlier italian movie according to the credits but was rewritten by two fairly popular american romantic comedy writers but this one by charles shyer nancy meyers does not cut it compared to their other efforts the story is about a couple of downandout traveling americans played by richard lewis and sean young who stumble upon a lost dog and hope to make a fortune in reward money after seeing an ad in the paper for the dachsunds return upon trying to return it they see a hand sticking out of a garage door at the ladys residence that they believe is attached to the rest of the dead body of the woman who is supposed to give them the money they freak out and instead of contacting the police and telling them the truth they make out like runaways from the scene expecting to be framed for the murder the other characters in the film are met on a train prior to this and hang around a monte carlo gambling resort doing various things to be pulled into the story the other cast members include character actors john candy james belushi cybill shepherd george hamilton and others after the police find out about the death they start questioning the main characters and of course they have to work thru their goofy lies to figure out what really happened none of the character actors mentioned earlier can bring this movie out of its mediocre state despite some funny moments mostly provided by the belushishepherd couple this isnt a horrible movie it just isnt that good there are plenty of average movies out there and this is just another one for the pile try it maybe youll like it probably you wont,1,0
1767,i have heard that novo was compared to memento for the simple fact they both rely on main characters suffering from shortterm memory loss well thats like comparing the silence of the lambs and friday the 13th as both involved a character that killed multiple people they couldnt be further apart in ideasnovo deals with a copier man at a company who does have short term memory loss he is consistently followed by another gentleman and his boss likes to have sex with him in the office in comes a temp who also gets involved with him and maymay not use him for sex needless to say he has a lot of onscreen sexwait theres more theres a boy who runs into the troubled amnesia male and its obvious theres more to this boy just bumping into him and theres a notebook the man keeps to try and remember important cluesi admit i am not one for foreignmade films i dont mind reading the subtitles but i do mind that sometimes that takes away from one of my favorite aspects of a film great dialogue since they have to translate or i wouldnt be able to understand for the most part i truly believe they simplify what the characters have to say this movie was no exception the dialogue was just well blahas for the story it was interesting enough to keep me around for 98 minutes weird yes but then again i dont live in france so i am not as familiar with their likesdislike or lifestyles such as i guess its acceptable for a father to lie with and frolic in the buff with his son on the beach that must be a cultural thing thankfully it wasnt two hours of time invested in watching this man regain his past and progressively move forward to his cure for when the secret is learned i was like really well okay theni can only recommend for somewhat decent acting good looking folks and softporn sexual situations like every 24 minutes however if youre not into that sort of scene i would wholeheartedly skip this slow moving and memoryregaining film,1,0

1838,some things just wont stay dead they just have to keep coming back for more whether we like it or not i guess some people like to beat a dead horse the first ghoulies was a surprise hit and its first sequel was an even better film the third film took a more comical approach and by this point the little buggers were starting to overstay their welcome i guess someone out there in hollywood thought it was a bright idea to resurrect the franchise but the outcome will likely disappoint fans of the previous entriespros the acting is actually pretty good for a movie like this a silly but fun score moves at an alright pace some cheese for those who love it some pretty good actionpacked sequences has a bit more plot than the others and unlike ii iii at least attempts to link itself with the originalcons not nearly as much fun as its predecessors though it has more plot than before its a pretty ridiculous one poor effects the original ghoulies only appear in flashbacks and here theyre replaced with two trolls who serve no purpose other than to be comic reliefs speaking of comedy all attempts at humor are lame is a direct sequel to the first film but there are so many loose ends for example i thought jonathan was done with black magic after what happened in the original not that it was spectacular in the others but this films direction is especially blandfinal thoughts the first three ghoulies movies are a bad movie lovers dream this fourth and so far final sequel lets hope is a bit of a letdown sure theres some fun to be had but it just isnt the same the others are low budget too but the people involved put a lot more into them see if youre a completeist or you wanna see beautiful women in skimpy outfits otherwise just stick with the other threemy rating 25,1,0

1846,i understand that this movie is made for kids and as a parent i have sat through many movies that dont particularly hold my interest but i can appreciate from a constructive point of view in how it is being received by my children parents are supposed to be encouraged after all to take part in their childrens activities and to monitor the quality of the entertainment that they view so there should be something that appeals to an adult audience on some level even in childrens movies disney has always understood this which is why it is so hard to fathom how it could allow such a complete piece of drek to bear their nametechnically the sound editing is horrible and all dialog sounds overdubbed and unnatural personally i hate that but it was doubly awful considering the dialog itself seemed as though it was written by a 12 year old for a school project the acting reminded me of a school play and none of the child actors had any range of emotion in their voices thankfully it was a very short movienow before i come off like a videogeek measuring a kids movie with an adult yard stick the one thing that can save even the worst childrens movie is a positive message far be it from me to determine how a message has to be delivered so long as the right one is let us take a walk through this film to see what messages are given if you are lost dont worry you will inevitably find your way homeapproach wild animals without any fearyou can win any competition just because you know you canand my favorite the final message left in the film its okay to disobey authority figures and do what you think is right,1,0

1873,whoever likened this one to raiders of the lost ark certainly knew whereof he spoke he might as well have likened it to some of the adventures of the pulp heroes that followed kay hoog reminds one more than a little of both lamont cranston the shadow and clark savage doc savage the shadow quintessential man of mystery and the very first dark knight was also thought to be one kent allard if one were to take savages first name first and add to it the kent you end up with voila clark kent funny innit like indiana jones hoog isnt above pilfering the artifacts of an ancient civilization though his thefts are often more blatant and less charmingly roguish than joness unfortunately this twoparter is a far cry from subsequent serials from any era in terms of overall quality one of the first indications that something is amiss vis a vis the cinematic storytelling is a scene where desperados on horseback quite literally breathing down his neck simply watch as hoog escapes their clutches in a hot air balloon why they dont bother to shoot down the balloon is just one of the many moviemaking mysteries that plague these two filmsthe second half of this twoparter is even worse than the first granted this was one of the first ever serials and as such should be cut a bit of slack but there are limits even to tolerance at one point the capture of the hero is effected not on screen but in the narration itself talk about cutting corners fritz lang happens to be one of the greatest filmmakers to ever make films unfortunately for those of us who admire most of what he did the spiders is a bitter pill indeed to swallow,1,0
1900,i bought this on dvd for my brother who is a big michelle pfeiffer fan i decided to watch it myself earlier this weekit is a reasonably entertaining piece containing two completely separate story lines the section with michelle pfeiffer was by far the more interesting of the two she plays a rising hollywood actress who has had many short unfulfilling relationships she literally bumps into brian kerwin a regular married guy with kidsafter driving her car into the back of his after being initially hostile to one another he offers to drive her home as she no longer feels comfortable to drive romance develops eventually leading to tragedy when his wife finds out what happens at the end i was not prepared for but the slow pacing and routine tv direction takes any drama out of the plotthe other section involves an old studio boss played by darren mcgavin this section actually has the better cast with kenneth mcmillan lois chiles steven bauer stella stevens they all want something from the studio boss but in the end when he is asked to resign they all realize their careers will now be going nowhere it passes the time but is not all that interesting and i am glad this was not bought for me i am not a michelle pffeifer fan but she was admittedly the only actor worth watching in this film and even in 1983 she was a decent actress overall though unless you are a fan of hers avoid this as it is very routine,1,0
1903,ok to start with this movie was not at all like the book i read the book when i was 13 and since then it has always been my favorite when im waiting for a different book to come out this is the book i turn to to fill in the time i have 3 copies for gods sake anyways i knew this was not going to be anything like the book but come on they could have done a little better than this i mean seriously if i wanted to watch american werewolf in paris or london than i would watch those movies they took a perfectly good story and twisted it around into a copy of a story that has been told over and over again and quite frankly im tired of watching it i mean hello the best part of the whole fg sorry story is she ends up with gabriel he doesnt die what was that about and hes old in this movie gabriel is supposed to be only 24 not 44 da it awww and astrid who the he came up with the idea of astrid being vivians aunt no no no no astrid and vivian hate each other awwww anyways yeah that was my little rant seriously pied off hope this helped,1,0
1929,saturday night live national lampoon and sctv alumnus are all together in a sometimes funny sketch filmhowever it is very interesting to watch now at the start of 2005 twenty years after this movie is supposed to take place look at how many of their gags have become absolutely true there is a mock movie trailer that probably wasnt even clever at the time for something called the pregnant man which came true with arnold schwarzeneggers dumb movie junior there is a commercial spoof that probably wasnt even clever at the time for something featuring sammy davis jr and jackie onasis called celebrity wrestling which has now come true with a popular show called celebrity boxing there is a mock movie trailer that probably wasnt even clever at the time that features john candy in a movie about a severed head watch this trailer and look how similar its shots and plot are to frank hellenlotters basket case and finally there is an ad for a late late show documentary about a dead dream the only two left the name of the documentary is the last hippies lolfour prophecies come true,1,0
1936,i got to see an early preview of this movie and i hope they have time to edit it in what ever way they can to improve on it before it comes out aug 3rd it stars andy samberg from saturday night live as hot rod kimble hes plays a teenager in a small town who wants to be a stunt man like his late father when we meet him hes jumping a mail truck on his moped yes a moped and almost makes it this would be worthy of a jackass movie if he wasnt honestly trying to do this isla fisher plays the slightly older and much more mature girlnextdoor denise she seems to like rod enough to join his crew jorma taccone also snl plays his half brother kevin who documents the stunts with a camcorder sissy spacek plays rods mom marie she remarried frank powell played by ian mcshane franks a real tough guy who enjoys beating rod in some real drag out brawls its clear that rods not going to earn franks respect till he can beat him we find out frank needs a 50000 heart transplant and rod is determined to raise the money just so he can beat his ass once hes healed and prove himself a man a long fall down a mountain side convinces rod to go big on one stunt rod sets out to get seed money by charging for doing stunts that would make you cringe if you saw them in real life like the human torch at a childrens birthday party there were those at the showing who managed to laugh at most of the stunts just when all hope and money is lost along comes a sponsor who saves the day by getting the 15 school buses rod wants to jump he gets exclusive broadcast rights and sets up phone lines to get donations rod gets a new outfit and a real motorcycle the whole town turns out and the world tunes in does he make the jump does he get the girl do they raise the 50k does frank get his ass beat by rod wait till this 90 minute movie comes out on video to find out,1,0
1940,then youd better not watch this movie theyve completely ruined the premise of the show in the movie the duke boys are idiots daisy is trampy roscoe is sinister boss hogg is capable uncle jessie is a criminalonly cooter and flash are true to the original characters at least enos is kinda closeat one point they open the doors to get into the general lee nuff saidthe original show may not have been great tv but it was entertaining and the characters made sense this movie is like dumb dumber meets the simple life,1,0
1975,blackwater valley exorcism is set on a small town ranch where teenager isabelle kristin erickson is found wandering around covered in dogs blood her parents ely randy colton blanche leslie flemingmitchell own the ranch are deeply worried about their daughter recently she has not been herself is considered a danger to herself others ranch hand expriest miguel del zamora recognises isabelles symptoms as a possible case of possession when she starts to speak ancient latin in a strange voice he becomes convinced of it blanche calls priest jacob cameron daddo who is her other daughter claires madison taylor ex husband to see isabelle he confirms miguels suspicions accepts the job of performing the exorcism that will hopefully banish the demon inside isabelle an innocent girl freedirected by ethan wiley i was sat there in my house in front of my telly watching blackwater valley exorcism i kept asking the same question over over again why do i do it why do i keep sitting through all these awful low budget horror films that look like they were shot on a camcorder right lets honest about this blackwater valley exorcism is a complete total utter unashamed ripoff of the exorcist 1973 you literally tick off the major plot points that the two share theres the possessed teenage girl who starts to get very horny suggest inappropriate things the demon that uses past misdemeanours against others the worried parents the way that the possessed girl is shunned by doctors the priest with a troubled past the possessed girl is tied to her bed amongst other things i suppose where blackwater valley exorcism is different other than its total crap is that it tries to give all the characters some screen time tries to get across how the situation is affecting them but its so badly written acted it just ends up being boring the film starts with isabelle already possessed so we never knew what she was like as a normal person so we never really care about her or what is happening to her either the rest of the characters are poorly written fleshed out at times i wondered whether blackwater valley exorcism was a spoof theres a silly scene in which a vet tries to sedate the possessed isabelle with horse tranquilisers after he states that she needs a little prick he enters her room with a huge needle hidden behind his back there are a few scenes in which people are punched accompanied by a silly comedy sound effect the film has an uneven tone as a result as it goes between silly spoof serious horror drama or it did in my opinion at leastaccording to some text before the opening credits blackwater valley exorcism was based on actual events yeah right actual events from 1973 that happened in a film called the exorcist this piece of text also states that the exorcism scenes were supervised by a real priest there isnt even any decent gore or exploitation to liven things up theres a scene of a cut arm theres a dead dog someone is stabbed with a crucifix thats about it theres surprisingly no bad language in it either despite the demon trying to be offencive i would imagine the only reason blackwater valley exorcism has an adult rating is because of one very brief scene in which a pair of breasts are seen one pair of naked female breasts is not worth the time watching this or the money you might spend on it there is zero scares no atmosphere a really amateurish feel to the whole film toowith a supposed budget of about 1000000 i must say that i am wondering where all the money went the film looks ugly cheap throughout there are no special effects to speak of the production values are rock bottom the acting is very poor from all involved genre favourite jeffrey combs gets near top billing during the opening credits but has nothing more than a cameo in what amounts to about five minutes of screen time even he must have feared how bad this was going to be has he hides behind a moustache a terrible accent he is better than thisblackwater valley exorcism is a complete ripoff of the exorcist without anything that made that film such a classic the makers are thirty five years too late anyway a total turkey from start to finish,1,0
1979,george sluizers original version of the vanishing aka the man who wanted to know offers one of european cinemas most quietly disturbing sociopaths and one of the most memorable finales of all time shamelessly stolen by tarantino for kill bill volume two but it has plenty more to offer than that playing around with chronology and inverting the usual clichs of standard lady vanishes plots it also offers superb characterisation and strong underplayed but convincing performancesunfortunately i can only assume that when it came to the remake sluizer was so determined that noone else was going to get the chance to ruin his film when he was perfectly capable of doing it himself but few people could have anticipated how comprehensively he trashes his own work his career never recovered from this disastrous misstepchief culprit is an astonishing performance by jeff bridges that has been over thought through in every detail to a truly disastrous level a friend who produced one of his earliest movies noted that bridges was a great instinctive actor as long as you stopped him thinking about what he was doing and this film is the proof of the pudding every movement is overly mechanical in its precision making him look like a rusty clockwork toy while his voice is a bizarre mixture of tootsie latka gravas from taxi and a dalek who have all been taking elocution lessons from doktah eville no banality of evil here just a looney walking around with an invisible sign over his head saying please let me kill you thank you for your consideration but the blame really needs to be shared out here none of the performances are good often they dont even look good keifer sutherland looks more like a baby hamster than a distraught man at his wits end in the hurried scenes at the gas station nancy travis flounders badly and sandra bullock makes no impression at all as the object of his obsession not that theyre given any help by either director or writer todd graff the script is particularly weak the chronology has been altered to put the focus firmly on bridges at the expense of the couple at the opening of the film worse is the rush the film is in draining the life and character from each scene in its race to get to the next rather than the highlow mood shifts in the couples relationship or the apparently casual but careful establishing of the feel of the location we just get a couple of arguments that give you the impression that hes probably better off without her as for the new and improved happy ending standard woman chased by nutter in the woods jeopardy stuff complete with lame lets end on a joke like a tv cop show moment best not go there which is advice that holds for this entire trainwreck of a movie even a shockingly bland and uninspired jerry goldsmith score cant do anything for this one,1,0

2009,the subject notwithstanding this is an amateur exhibitionist movieor an effort at onewhich is about as interesting and daring as a moody high school students composition book full of death poetry to be sure it will disturb viewers who are hellbent on being disturbed but the success will be attributable to themselves not to the director to genuinely get under somebodys skin requires sensibility discipline technique and talent as well as an eye and an ear the film does contain one evocative image shown as a still and also used on the video case but with no development leading up to or away from it if the director had had an eye he would have seen it as a possible starting point for an interesting moviethat is a movie,1,0

2067,i just watched it a couple of laughs but nothing to write home about jason lee looked like he was having fun the long dvd gag reel consists almost solely of him having fits of uncontrollable laughter selma blair seemed to be punching a time clock but then again her character was supposed to be a stick in the mud so well done i guess jim brolin was surprisingly funny being married to babs cant be a picnic the soundtrack was hip and eclectic larry miller who played julia stiles father hilariously in 10 things i hate about you is funny here as well hes great but the best aspect of this movie was the casting of julia stiles i could spend two hours watching her fold laundry and i feel like i just did,1,0
2083,ivan the terrible is more a filmed stage play than a bigscreenopus citizen kane a similar work in many ways is quite the opposite in the way we come to expect such fare in that it has lots of location shooting for exampleacting is meant to convey a characters motivations and thinking to the audience if it succeeds in making you understand the character what does it matter how it was done and considering the low amount of action how else is one to express events that influence the story and consequently the characters machinations and decisions other than exaggerated movementsas well theres a historical level why the acting style should not surprise the rise of totalitarian regimes in germany and ussr forced filmmakers who stayed behind to make films the way they knew how as they were prevented access to more modern works that showed cinemas evolution and techniques they only used what they knewthe nazis control of government in germany destroyed the great german film industry of the 1920s due to their total control over that film industry and propaganda films can only entertain german troops so much hence the need for popular german silent films of the 1920s for example so a lot of ivan the terrible films techniques would have been derived from such captured german films supplied to the film crew as mentioned in other commentsthere was no confusion anywhere and though personally it was found overhyped it is by no means a bad cinematic experience and definitely not amongst the worse films ever the acting is fine and part of the cinematography excellent even by todays standards more below definitely not a popcorn flick one cant leave their brain outside this ones door dated perhaps and very symbolic only worth watching on the big screen if one is unable to view the films with the lights off at home for many of the cinematic elements will be lost in these films chiefly bw experience it all depends upon what expectations one walks in withwarning spoilers do not read the following comments in case they influence your personal view of the filmsand if one does not mind the obvious communist propaganda as opposed to capitalist propaganda for ivan is how stalin saw himself obvious in his influence on the films direction see other comments and anyone with a world historical awareness outside the us perspective will definitely understand this maybe ivan was an earlier incarnation of stalin or maybe not this is more a diatribe on stalin and his motivations decisions loneliness promotions of lackeys etc using the persona of ivan than any true historical record of ivan also note the obvious use of particular colours in the sequel red for the ussr in the banquet scene and perhaps blue for the usa during certain shots when the usurper wears the crownbut it has many excellent visuals such as the profound use of shadows or the exterior shot of the populace coming to beg ivans return to moscow,1,0

2093,ok so this film is well acted it has good direction but the simple fact is that it undermines what all gay and lesbian people have been fighting for all these years the straight man deciding to be gay and the gay man deciding to be straight i did enjoy it up until the last 20 minutes after that i got really offended as what usually happens in these films the straight actors play the main parts and the out gay actors play the secondary straight roles the leads are played by handsome men but dont let that distract you from the fact that this is a a film that leaves you feeling unfulfilled all the romance and relationships you hope would happen do not unless you are a priest that is in which case god bless straight woman who cure our homos,1,0
2146,i was thrilled by the fresh pun intended synopsis of this film and looking forward to watch it the first few shots introduce some of the characters as well as the main location where the stories take place the gardening allotments the movie looks fantastic colorful yet simple magical yet genuine unfortunately it only takes a few minutes to figure out where the movie will go we quickly figure out this will be a manipulative sappy tale illustrating a bunch of jaded people set in their ways confronted by nice victimized refugees and that it will have a happy ending where the jaded people realize the error of their ways and accept these people the characters particularly the prejudiced ones are very comicbooky in nature the story focuses mainly on two refugee families one of them is headed by a single mom played atrociously by diveen henry i am saddened to say that any emotion that might have been felt toward her struggles were defused by what was memorably bad actingthe other story is much more interesting and focuses on a father and his two children all are scarred by their journey to this country by way of containers where the wife and mother died but it is the husband who suffers the most benedict wong gives a mindblowing performance here at first his emotions are very subdued but as the story develops he subtly makes us aware of the innerstruggles of his character unfortunately the rest of the movie is just extremely boring there were so many possibilities with this movie there are several characters to keep track of many of which might have potential but none of it is realized even worse despite this movie being very much not hollywoodian some of the main plot threads are solved cheaply in a hollywood bgrade way examplecharacter a likes character b character b rejects his advances no problem lets have character c declare her love for character a so we can all have a happy ending yawn i liked very much the plot thread of the asian family that was well done unfortunately the whole allotment business the communal aspect of it the dynamic involving a large cast are all under exploitedwhat youre left with is a movie that has very little worth,1,0

2169,i always think it would be nice if you could somehow have a sneak preview at some of the old movies that are rereleased on dvd before you purchase them that way you could save yourself some time money and a certain degree of aggro when you feel so utterly let downthe buddy holly story is such a moviei do not wish to go into the characterizations or the holes in the plot or the messing around with historical facts that this movie encompasses for i had already come to terms with them twenty years ago when i first began watching iti had recorded it on the old monaural beta machine back in the early 1980s and liked it so much that it became a regularlyplayed favourite the best part to my mind was gary buseys performance as the young buddy and his nearperfect vocals and guitar playingi looked forward to the day when i could have it in stereo and that is where the disappointment comes inthis dvd version is supposedly remastered in both audio and video according to the shell information but im afraid it left me sadly letdown and glancing at my watch wishing for it to endthe sound is murky bordering on the unintelligible and so unprofessionally mixed that it had me yearning for the crystalclarity vocals of my old beta tape despite what you think of the images or the plot or the characters the real draw card here is the musicand if you cant hear the lead vocals because they are drowned out by the cymbals or the backing harmonies or other ambients then theres not much left is there im going to convert my old beta version to mono dvd for subsequent viewings and put this one where it belongs out with the rubbish extinction is the rule survival is the exception,1,0
2207,world war i gets a glossy sepiatinted makeover in jeanpierre jeunets relentlessly whimsical a very long engagement jeunets trademark style consists of mechanical almost clockworklike narrative construction garnished with lavish chocolate box production values and seasoned with fauxnaive humour its an approach that worked pretty well with his previous picture the romantic fantasy amelie thanks in no small part to the inimitable contribution of audrey tatou in the title role applied to vastly more sombre material jeunets method backfires rather badlytatou crops up again here in a variation on the same sort of sweetly offbeat character as amelie shes mathilde an orphan who lives quietly with her aunt and uncle in an idyllic rural setting determined to trace what became of her child sweetheart manech gaspard ulliel several years after he went missing in the war manech was one of five soldiers courtmartialled for selfmutilation in 1917 at bingo crepuscule and sent over the top into nomansland as a punishment hes presumed dead by all but mathilde who cherishes the hope of finding him the film follows mathildes dogged quest to find out what really happened and as she delves deeper she uncovers a sad even shocking story of highranking corruption and inhumanity mathilde must filter the facts from the fictions that arise from various conflicting overlapping or incomplete accounts of what seem to be manechs final hoursall this should be poignant and gripping but its more often simply confusing thanks to the visual and verbal clutter with which jeunet pummels his audience theres simply too much going on at any one time including an intrusive narration that adds precisely nothing to our appreciation of the story and characters without a moments respite from informational overload i felt denied the space to reflect on mathildes quest or the room to engage with it on my own terms jeunets unceasingly busy camera spirals and swoops and circles caressing every surface contour of his exquisitely designed production but it singularly fails to penetrate to the soul beneath the storys skin the result is deeply uninvolving and worse grotesque the first world war was a particularly dark hour in human history imagine it recreated as one of those picturesque commercials for a well known belgian lager and you have the measure of this film,1,0
2219,i am quite a fan of novelistscreenwriter michael chabon his novel wonder boys became a fantastic movie by curtis hanson his masterful novel the amazing adventures of kavalier and clay won the pulitzer prize a few years back and he had a hand in the script of spider man 2 arguably the greatest comic book movie of all timedirector rawson marshall thurber has also directed wonderful comedic pieces such as the gutbusting dodgeball and the genius short film series terry tate office linebacker and with a cast including peter saarsgard sienna miller nick nolte and mena suvari this seems like a nobrainerit is literallyjon foster stars as art bechstein the son of a mobster nolte who recently graduated with a degree in economics jon is in a state of arrested development he works a minimum wage job at book barn has a vapid relationship with his girlfriendboss phlox suvari which amounts to little more than copious amounts of sex with no plans other than to chip away at a career for which he has zero passionone night at a party an exroommate introduces jon to jane miller a beautiful smart violinist later that night they go out for pie and she asks jon a question that begins to shake him from his catatonic state of existence i want you to tell me something that you have never told a single soul if you do it will make this night indelible jon then tells her a reoccurring dream of his in which he wanders about town looking at the faces of strangers passing him by yet none of them look him in the eye i imagine it must be what death feels like he saysthe next day janes wild boyfriend cleveland saarsgard kidnaps jon from work and takes him out to a hulking abandoned steel mill and soon jon cleveland and jane are spending every waking moment together going to punk rock concerts doing drugs and drinking lots of alcohol this doesnt sit well with phlox who pushes jon for a more personal relationship namely letting her meet his new friends and his father the film then attempts to take us on jons journey as he shakes off the shackles imposed on him by his father phlox and his deadend job as he finds freedom and expression through his relationships with cleveland and janethere is a problem having us follow jon throughout the film hes completely uninteresting he has no ambitions passions or goals he walks through life like the invisible wraith he described to jane the night they met at the outset this isnt a problem but he never gets any more interesting hes a completely passive character he simply follows along the bohemian cleveland and jane but he never once gives us any inkling as to what he cares about or wants to to do with himselfconsequently the film and its supporting characters have nowhere to go and little to do other than party have sex and get in arguments in other words much ado about nothing what we have here is the shallow skin of a good movie without anything on the inside sweeping cinematography ponderous voiceover with characters staring off into the distance lots of sex scenes both straight and gay big arguments more angry sex a chase scene and a tragic death but it doesnt seem to matter ironically at one point jane confused at a number of jons aimless actions asks him whats going on jon what is this all about yes jon do tell we in the audience are dying to know toothe title the mysteries of pittsburgh must refer to the characters themselves because thats what they are they are all facades onedimensional standins for actual people the film never lets us in we never know what makes any of them tick we see them do lots of things but we dont know why and the absence of why is one of the worst things a movie can have,1,0
2220,this show has been performed live around the country with a wide variety of casts i saw it first in the provincetown production the first summer it was in ptown 2001before it was curiously enough banned in that overwhelmingly gay resort the codes which resulted in its closing have since been amended i saw it again later in the offbroadway longrunning production in new york oddly enough the ptown production was far better than the new york onefresher cuter more spirited and funnierbut that was only in the 2001 showing subsequent attempts to clone the production bare naked lads in 2007 were definitely thirdrate this filmed production features a los angelos production cast and it is as other comments have suggested not the best i would rate it somewhere in between the topnotch 2001 ptown production and the thirdrate bare naked lads ptown show from last summer,1,0
2226,i can hardly believe i watched this again last night after more than 25 yearssome time back i watched 6 fu films in a row boris karloff and all 5 chris lees the last 2 lees both directed and i use that word loosely by jess franco were abominable at the time i skipped this one remembering that in some ways it was even worsewell i watched it never again you know whats worse that an abominable film a really wellmade piece of s and thats what fiendish plot is it is a very goodlooking movie great production design sets costumes music photography editing mostly good cast some decent actingand absolutely positively one of the worst scripts in movie history aaaugh the first minute of the film is so deceptive one might mistake this for a decent movie and then they start singing happy birthday to fu and it goes downhill having burt kwouk of whom his master says your face is familiar accidentally pour out fus elixir vitae to put out a fire resulting in his being condemned to torture burial and having one of his ears cut off was the closest thing to funny they had it was like someone decided they wanted to do a campy film so ridiculous it would be funny ridiculous it is funny it aint at allits sad because its clear in the first few minutes that someone did a lot of research into the fu manchu series in order to get so much of it right with a different script either a really funny one or a dead serious one they might have could have should have had a classic on their hands a film that could have made one forget the horror of those jess franco atrocities instead of making one want to dig them out as masterpieces by comparisonthere was a period in the late 70s when a whole slew of classic 30s characters were revived in movies that were universally awful buck rogers flash gordon tarzan the lone ranger charlie chan even doc savage im not sure this one may be the worst of the lot it took great selfcontrol not to fastforward over whole sections of it especially any scenes containing sid caesar fbi chief who was also al capones cousin you see what i mean it isnt just that the ideas in the film arent funny they often make no sense whatsoever like when they audition police officers to impersonate the king and queen and we wind up seeing people audition dancehall routines like singing dancing and riding a unicycle how many drugs did the writers of this thing have to take for any of this to make sense to them as i said a shame and a real waste of all that talent including that of peter sellers who played both fu and nayland smith burt kwouk whod been in a chris lee fu film in his time helen mirren the police woman who shockingly falls in love with the villain and damn near steals the last halfhour of the film i begin to wonder if anyone will ever make a proper fu manchu film or if fans will have to settle for karloffs being almost the only one,1,0
2227,well i only caught the tail end of this film on hbo just the final 10 minutes or so but i must say that it contains probably the most laughable depiction of distance running ever put on film im a serious distance runner and a dedicated fan of the sport and ive sat through many painful demonstrations in movies before however nothing could have ever prepared me for what is shown on screen in the final 10 minutes of this movie it literally defies belief the depiction of the runners is even more ironic considering that african runners completely dominate the sport and they are elegant and graceful the female protagonist shuffles along like an overweight pregnant woman and her highly trained male supporters are no better well into the race this alleged world class runner is surrounded by pudgy overweight people many of whom are walking i find it interesting that the director decided to have her lead the female competition yet near the end she is shown passing people who look like theyre staggering along on two broken legs are we to believe that this amazing stellar athlete has only overtaken a crippled person at the very end of the race maybe the director just thinks that female runners cant run faster than 12 minute miles and he has obviously never heard of athletes like paula radcliffe or tirunesh dibabaeven if you arent a running fan youll be astonished by the insanely inaccurate portrayal of running and this movie is only watchable as unintentional comedy here is a note to the director the next time you decide to make a movie about a sport it might be worth it to hire at least one person who actually has observed that sport in action,1,0
2232,by all appearances this serial could have been made any time since the mid forties the cardboard sets the moon kings with lightning bolts sewn onto their aprons you know the drill this one is a rocky jones adventure featuring the space cops dealings with the insufferable bitch queen of planet offeecious a commie planet that wont join the united planets when the noble messengers of intergalactic reason announce that offeecious is on a collision course with this other vaguely slavic planet bitch queen decides to blow the other guys up rather than evacuate her land this introduces a moral to the effect of the greatness of a nation is not in its land but its people which is hammered home five or six times in the climactic talkfest the bqs constant nasal ranting about offeeeecious provides relief from some seriously wanting space effects is this a tv show,1,0
2233,as most of you ive watch a lot of great movies in between those we often either voluntarily or mistakenly also find those movies that are so pointless that we think of reasons as to why anyone would make it this is exactly what i can say for dead mans bountythe very least i can do is try to warn some of you if you enjoy being entertained by a motion picture because of the story acting and intensity than you might want to chose something else now its not all badin fact if all you want is creative film editing and unique angles along with original music ambient than you might think its ok as someone that values movie plots acting and being entertained by a film the truth is i thought this movie was so terrible beyond words i could easily find a spot for it on my list of worst movies seen in a while as for having val kilmer in this the truth is he was casted probably as a favor to the director as a fan of some of kilmers films i cant understand what his motive for this was the movie seems part western part romancein the end im sure most of you can agree with me that it simply is a rude waste of our time in case you havent seen this movie my recommendation would be to avoid it completely,1,0
2259,at the beginning we get to see the start of a secret council of some sorts it all looks very promising from the get go with some supernatural elements thrown in the mystery gets more interesting by the minute the main character who seems like a good bloke gets into trouble because of his claim for money he is entitled to temptation and other factors you really empathize with the guy and you want to know what exactly is going on normally a person in his situation would have several options somehow he does not have those options in this movie there only seems to be one solution even when it is clear it is not his fault out of the blue he encounters characters who talk about churchprayer and god and they provide the answer for his problem it should be obvious at a point in the movie what this solution is now let me say that there is nothing wrong with this message since it always is helpful but was it really necessary to disguise this message this religious element actually ruined the viewing experience for me while the message is goodits simplicity cant escape the fact that in real life more needs to happen to resolve issues presented in this movie the mystery that is presented to us never gets solved in stead you are forced to deal with another topic that essentially has nothing to do with the plot dont get fooled because of malcolm mcdowell the once brilliant actor is adequatebut if you watch closely you will see that he is not serious at all he really must be desperate for money otherwise what would posses an actor of his caliber to act in a movie like this,1,0
2268,on the pure theatrical side last stand was great as the reenactments and soundtrack are very entertaining but there are better accounts of this battle found elsewhere that while not as long or as flashy are far more historically comprehensivecertain little details such as the misuse of the word hoplon for the greek hoplite shield and the mispronounciations of various names and words really ate at memy guess would be that because last stand of the 300 was aired the eve of the theatrical release of 300 the history channel was only trying to ride the coattails of the movies hypeif youre looking for a depiction thats historically accurate in all respects possible youd have better luck elsewhere,1,0

2325,i couldnt relate to this film im surprised that people are lauding it for being so realistic how many people at your school were victim to incest how many closet homosexual jocks were there how many quiet people that you never noticed committed suicide hmmm ok you wouldnt know even if their were but really these are explosive problems which many us never deal with and yet there are so many teenagers with subtle problems which could have been explored but hey wheres the entertainment in thatwith regards to the girl who committed suicide i found this to be exploitative i actually think many people in high school at some stage feel invisible ignored and unwanted but what possesses someone to violently commit suicide on just another day of being ignored and unnoticed the filmmaker decided this girl would suicide to make the film more provocative and the graphic nature of the suicide to make it even more provocative i didnt buy it as a real life scenarioand the problems of the other students i didnt fully relate to bullying is explored but thats been done to death we all know it goes on and it truly is a matter of resolve within that person closet homosexuality pfft another clich gets rolled out thats the thing really too many clichs i guessed the ending at the start there was a predictable unpredictability if that makes sense youve got all these characters with explosive problems and one with apparently none and i thought what is the point of this character unless shes the unsuspecting suicide victim and surely enoughone thing i will say and it is the saving grace of the film is that it does not glamourise suicide the suicide is very graphic and heartbreaking to watch it is a powerful scene regardless of how contrived it isand one that dismisses suicide as the easy option but the film is really not very imaginative and used stereotypesnot bad but certainly not groundbreaking or worthy of a 17minute standing ovation at cannes,1,0
2331,earnest effort which achieves some success to adapt the classic odyssey story to a 30s nostalgia period piece the adventurers this time are escaped convicts wandering about the depression afflicted south bungling their way into troublethe greatest strength of the film is the wonderful music soundtrack effectively evoking not only the era that this is set in but the spiritual references that run rampant in the film besides its value to the tone of the movie the music is just plain fun to listen towhat cripples the film is that the characters really arent that likable in a comedy you need that element in order to have fun along with them in their misadventures instead we have a bunch of selfish arrogant soulless mean spirited nobodies who really have no positive points at all theyre not imposing enough to make you hate them either so its hard to relate to them at all theyre offered up as clowns but like people who put clown makeup on and march in parades they just arent funnylike the story that inspired it the movie takes these guys on an odyssey encountering a variety of symbolic some even mystical characters everybody is stamped with offensive stereotypes the operative word being stupid people are mocked right and left and consequently no one is left being particularly interesting or appealing the movie doesnt like its own characters and it doesnt let you like them eitherriverside baptisms beautiful sirens stolen cars fistfights radio preachers people being whipped with sticks all are thrown at you in disjointed fashion some evoke a few laughs others confuse or bore you i did laugh when a nerdy guy beat the snot out of an especially obnoxious lead character but there were a lot more pointlessly gratuitous scenes an example some 30s dillingertype guy strafes cows with a tommygun comedy symbolism no just mindless violence which detracts from the intellectual nature of the original source material this story draws uponother adaptations of the odyssey are much better unless youre a george clooney fan rent something else but buy the soundtrack cd the music is great,1,0
2339,in cold blood was one of several 60s films that created a new vision of violence in the hollywood film industry capote coined the phrase nonfiction novel to describe the book on which this film is based and the spirit of that form was carried over into the film script which he cowrote despite the fact that we were well into the era of color film richard brooks elected to present this film in black and white to underscore both the starkness of the landscape and the bleakness of the story this is the first problem with the tv remake color changes the tone of the story in addition the confinement of shooting a film for tv makes reduces the options of how the shots are framed and focused as a result we lose the dramatic clash which makes the second part of the original film police interviews trial imprisonment and execution so claustrophobic on the small screen its just another version of law and order spinoffs hollywoods search for scripts continuously takes it back to movies that were successful in another age usually thats a mistake and this is no exceptionall of the actors are competent the script is ok the directing doesnt get in the way its just that the movie doesnt work as well as the original precision instrument it doesnt hook the viewer into the ambivalence toward smith and hickock that the original film provokes at the end of the tv version we are left with the feeling ho hum who caressee the original first on as large a screen as you can then watch the tv version simply to understand why the first one was such an important film in 1967wouldnt hurt to also go on line and read a bit about capote and the original book it will help you to understand the extraordinary effort he put into the material and also some of the controversy surrounding both the book and the moviei actually only gave this a 4 because i save the bottom 3 rankings for true bombsthe kind that enrage you about having been sucked into spending an,1,0

2371,first let me say im not someone who usually cringe at the fact of having to think while seeing movies i love tarkowsky movies for example berghman is also a favoritebut this the positive points can be summed up easily the photography is splendid and the music is perfectdoes it make a good movie i used to think so but this one is a perfect example of one that for me doesnt make it maybe its because im too dumb possible but i dont think so tarkwosky for example also used very long shots but what he never did was filming 5 minutes of the exact same image of two people walking and i mean just their heads because in this movie there are a lot of those shots but sometimes it is effective the general result is plainly boring even with the intelligent undertones which are done in a way that while intelligent is above all very pedanticyou also always feel that the director is making some of the long shots not for the aesthetic or symbolic effect but just to spare on budgetim very disappointed in this film because i really liked the first 30 minutes or so but it just went on and on without even keeping the same level as in the first sceneswhile reading the very praising comments on this page i also get the feeling some people just try to see much more in the movie than there is to itwhen a movie is slow and arty it doesnt necessarily mean it is very profoundyes it is an allegory on musical theory placed in the context of a small town which is quite interesting on itself but it does not make a profound movieexcept for people who absolutely want to make some sort of intellectual masturbation out of it but then its not what you find in the movie but what you find in yourselfan exercise that in my opinion can be made much more effectively while watching stalker or solyaris than werckmeister harmonies that owes much to tarkowsky but cab never equal its level,1,0

2474,a new generation is the third amityville entry to base its plot around writer john g joness premise of an item taken from the long island house that causes spectral misery and death for its new owners first a lamp then a clock and now a mirror however this is also the first amityville since the possession to directly tie in to the real life events that started the whole series this time around keyes terry robert partridge an artist is given a macabrelooking mirror by a homeless man one day soon enough people around him start to die eventually leading to his discovery that the mirror once hung in the amityville house indeed on the very night a man named franklin bronner sonny montelli in amityville ii murdered his entire family unfortunately for terry his discovery of the mirror isnt entirely coincidental and he soon learns the truth about his past a truth hes kept buried since childhoodthis 7th installment in the often wornout franchise is something of a disappointment for me things were starting to pick up with the silly and uneven yet entertaining its about time and given how much this film tries to draw upon its roots not the first episode but the source material itself it should have been better than it was however three trips to the same well with yet another evil artifact from the amityville house with yet another explanation for the malign paranormal visitations is wearing on me to say the least one of the biggest weaknesses of the amityville franchise is the steadfast determination by each set of producers to completely ignore every other episode in the series on the one hand its perfectly reasonable that they dont want to be tied to someone elses continuity but at the very least they could maybe acknowledge story lines that have already been done and just possibly not repeat them over and over againtheres also something rather plodding about the way in which the story unfolds doubtless due to the inevitability this repetitionfest brings since you already know whats going to happen the carefullypaced buildup is simply slow and tedious or maybe its just tedious anyway director john murlowski probably could have done more to heighten the tense atmosphere associated with the mirror rather than simply having it flash red and emit chattering evil voices which lacks any kind of subtlety there were times when characters seemed fairly unfazed by its otherworldly qualities if they dont take it too seriously why should wewhich is a shame because a new generation has a morethancapable cast i was going to hold off on watching this until i saw the name julia nickson in the credits she captivated my attention just as she always does and if anything i was annoyed her part wasnt more extensive terry oquinn was equally charismatic and again underused partridge himself in the lead role clearly fits the early 90s overcoiffed lumberjackshirted squarejawed hero type and while im not sure he really gave it the gravitas needed its not as if anyone here is performing ibsenthe sets are also worthy of note from the dramatic artwork filling sukis room to the claustrophobic corridors featured in flashbacksupernatural sequences getting the look of these right is especially important given how certain sequences are repeated throughout the film to simulated fragmented memories clearly murlowski is more of a visual director rather than either an actors director or one of horror unfortunately it is meant to be a horror film after alla new generation sees the same race being run for the third time in 4 years add to this the lack of direction where it was really needed and the whole effort fails to stand as tall as it should however it should be acknowledged for its strong ties with the source material and some good actors in not necessarily their finest hours honestly the ideal person for this is someone who hasnt seen any of the sequels past the possession for whom the story wont be such a massive dejavu trip,1,0
2501,this film captures the short moments between a mother and son in rural russia as she lays dyingi am so torn between being nice to the film or declaring it a test of patience on one hand the film is beautiful with the sparse dialog capturing the essence of their feelings there is really nothing to say because everything that needs to be said is conveyed beyond words the son shows so much care love and patience towards his mother that i think it is a celebration of unconditional love towards ones family it also cruelly reminds me that i could be in a situation like this stuck in a joyless place having to take care of a very ill person mat i syn is cruel realityon the other hand mat i syn moves really too slowly do i really need to watch a train passing by the horizon for over 1 minute with my previous experience of telets and aleksandra i am so tempted to put mat i syn among them as a total borei guess one has to be in the right state of mind to appreciate this film i surely see the beauty of it but maybe i am not in the right state of mind,1,0

2506,quintet marks the only venture of both paul newman and director robert altman into the realm of science fiction it was said of newman that he could not do comedy but he tried until he finally scored a real success in that genre with slap shot but the failure of this film left him gun shy and he never tried it againthis is one of the biggest downer films ive ever seen its a futuristic ice age brought on by who knows what but presumably its a nuclear winter even during the ice age of thousands of years ago the equatorial parts of the earth still sustained animal and human life but apparently not here seals have survived and paul newman is a seal hunter on the outsidebut hunters do need a little rr and newman goes to a futuristic city where things are so boring the natives have some kind of game played with six people and its a kind of russian roulette to win you have to kill five other participants in your gameits a sad turn to see what man has come down to which is one of the reasons i just could not get into this story the atmosphere is bleak the story is bleak the people are bleak its all so bleak no wonder this thing came up short at the box officeits a film that just about everyone thinks is never going to be on the top ten list of paul newman films including methis is mans future what a bummer,1,0
2527,i was so excited and hyped up about watching this film when the promos first came out in november it looked awesome and the songs i was quite disappointed when i went to watch it this is a film which weaves 6 couples together it has a multi cast of 12 people a huge amount of stars have worked on this film i think the director nikhil advani has not managed the situation well and should not have had many people in this movie as this would of made it easier for him compared to nikhils directorial debut kal ho naa ho salaameishq falls quite behind i think nikhil should have a smaller star cast i think the best factors of this film is the songs the songs are excellent and i think that all of the songs are awesome shankarehsaanloy done an excellent job and have done an excellent jobs over the years i think the ratings of this movie may go up because of the excellent songs one thing i was disappointed with is that the director should not have included nudity in this film which is done by sohail khan and isha koppikar i found this extremely rude watching this with family although some may find this nude as comedy it is not something you would want to watch with parents i think the best acting was performed by salman and priyanka overall i think its an alright movie,1,0
2591,i saw this movie one time at a kiddie matine at the north park theater in san diego in 1959 when it was released and i was 11 it was one of three features that were shown that dayi have not seen it since but have wanted to because i am a film buff and appreciate the terrible along with the great good and average filmswhat i remember most vividly is that the more sophisticated audience members consisting of children between 8 and 15 howled with laughter at the tree monstera triple bill at a theater showing 3 adventure films is something an 11 year old does not forget but i cant remember the names of the other 2 films one did star george montgomery and david farrarupdate the other 2 films in this triple bill were much better they were watusi 1959 with george montgomery and david farrar starring and the angry red planet 1959 with gerald mohr and naura hayden staring ms hayden has written a couple of books on health and fitness also,1,0
2594,years ago i saw the godfather and it made a lasting impression on me the atmosphere of the movie was first class the acting memorable and the storyline a classic recently i bought the trilogy and after watching part 1 again i looked eagerly to viewing part 2 i was so pleased to realize early on into part 2 that here was a fitting follow on to the great godfather movie again everything was just about perfect and i could not wait to see godfather iii wrong i wish id stopped at ii the storyline was not good it seemed to me like a story made up just to have a story the characters were weak especially the daughter pacinos protege was a weak character that would have been eaten alive in godfather 1 or 2 then scenes such as corleone being invested with all the trappings of the catholic church with full choir the assassin on horseback riding away into the sunset the unseen helicopter machine gunning of the meeting where the goodies get away and everyone else is shotdaughter and 1st cousin rolling bits of pasta across a board the pathetic shooting on the steps corleone stuffing sweets down him with orange juice for diabetes a man of his intelligence and guile isnt ready for an emergency no it was not good and with the best will in the world i wont be able to watch it again but ill watch 1 2 many times down the years,1,0
2606,i was only cautiously enthusiast when renting all the boys love mandy lane as i instantly remembered hearing reading a wide variety of opinions both positive and negative in the short period of time between its brief cinematic release and the distribution towards videostore shelves supposedly this was the most ingenious and refreshing new horror film in years with nonstereotypical teen characters and unpredictable plot twists for a change okay the basic concept may perhaps sound reasonably innovative but inevitably the screenplay quickly reverts to the same old and irritating slasher clichs and once passed that point even the nifty stylistic trademarks cant save the film from dreadful mediocrity the opening sequences are indeed terrific and literally bath in a moodily melancholic ambiance which actually makes it all the more painful to witness the film sink towards the ordinary level of rudimentary slasher flick after the sublime intro showcasing a drunk macho kid miscalculate his jump off a rooftop in order to impress the titular beauty all the boys love mandy lane turns out to be just another textbook and uninspired horror movie about a bunch of idiotic kids getting stoned and horny on a secluded ranch before getting killed off by a notsounidentified maniac the films entire pretentious setup collapses faster than a ramshackle house of cards we never get a proper explanation why mandy herself behaves so frigid and haughty towards all her admirers because she grew up an orphan perhaps oh boohoo the boys soon enough illustrate theyd settle for sex with any random bimbo and not exclusively with the divine mandy and the final twist albeit undeniably offbeat is just plain senseless the middle section of is rather boring and doesnt even offer any genuinely horrific excitement shotgun killings please or authentic rancid sleaze my generous rating 4 out of 10 entirely goes to the grainy and unsettling 70s filming style with faded colors bizarre but beautiful photographic images and the surprisingly marvelous soundtrack director jonathan levine opted for the classic bobby vinton song sealed with a kiss to play during the trailer and endcredits whereas i initially was convinced the film would inevitably feature barry manilows cheesy lovesong mandy,1,0
2618,this film really got off to a great start it had the potential to turn into a really heartrending romantic love story with cinematography that recorded the love between harlan and tobe in long poetic and idyllic scenes it really didnt need to be anything more than that and for a moment there i became excited that someone was finally making a beautiful film for its own sake another timeless classic a modern myth perhaps why oh why then mess it up halfway through by making the lead character nortonanother psycho maybe im missing the point but do we really need another film about psychos or is this need in hollywood to portray the sick side of human nature indicative of a more general malaise in the movie industry for a moment there i was going to make a mental note of the directors name now im left feeling indifferent at least it should be added in the films defense that all the actors seemed to invest in their roles also evan rachel wood is really lovely to look at and a good actress with lots of potential,1,0
2635,im a fan of this generally excellent though sometimes rather dull show but season 3 has taken some terrible plot directions the episode hero is an example of what i meanthe story as it eventually unravels is that the cylons deliberately allow bulldog a pilot captured several years earlier during a black ops mission to escape steal a cylon ship and get back to galactica the plan is that when bulldog gets back he will figure out that adama left him to his fate and be so enraged that he will kill adama which he very nearly doesnow the problem is this the cylons set it up so that bulldog thinks he has escaped by himself this means that bulldog gets off the cylon ship with no assistance so he kills a cylon and walks out of his holding cell that much we see then we must suppose that he walks to the flight hangar manages to get into a cylon fighter ship and learn how to operate it takes off and flies back to galactica just like thatnow starbuck managed to get one of them working in season one which was barely believable in itself but she only had to fly it visually out of orbit before making contact with galactica bulldog has to programme his ship so that it makes several jumps through hyperspace and manages to catch up with galactica somewhere thousands of light years away in an unknown direction how does he manage to programme a ship that contains completely alien technology cylons connect to their computers by touch there are no visual consoles or keyboards and having managed that miraculous feat how does he then know where galactica is bearing in mind that galactica took off some 3 years before and is trying ever since to evade the cylons it does not leave beacons behind even allowing for the suspension of disbelief that must apply to any scifi show this episode still absolutely no sense whatsoever,1,0
2644,i watched this movie a couple of weeks ago and must say i was not impressed not at all i do side with the other posters when it comes to the fine performances but some good performances do not make a good movieon the discussion board i found a review by an anonymous poster that captured some of the main points it says deed poll is a movie that raises many questions but hardly answers even a few a movie that is disturbing and above every attempt at categorizing an experiment and a very conventional sexual drama despite some shocking scenes the brilliant acting of barbara kowa and andr schneider the partly very impressive editing and the good camera work steffen ritter make up for gross plot holes and some technical slips especially in sound however the boredom the audiences have to deal with for 40 minutes remains unfortunately this is true i wasnt intrigued by the story at all the protagonists are cold ambitionless people they do a lot of drugs and have a lot of incestuous sex so what for many times the direction seemed to be virtually nonexistent not to mention the technical aspect the poor sound quality was enormously disturbingwhats the point of the movie whats the message behind it all the anonymous reviewer said somehow biermann failed to make a clear point and so the movie remains hanging in midair without a message thus the boredom i blame on the movie the movie is reserved and emotionless cold almost neutral and it doesnt take long to see the flaws for long stretches the characters of sean and ivy are not credible they clearly have difficulties with the english pronunciation the character of the mute brother is not developed very well some moments are very promising though in the scene where the call boy is skinned the one and only true love scene an intensity is reached that one would love to see the whole movie long as a spectator one has to regret the chances given away again i must agree i did like the final scene especially because of the beautifully captured faces of gianni meurer and andr schneider but it was nothing compared to the boredom i had to suffer for the first thirty minutes the sex scenes though were aesthetically staged and perfectly editedall in all deed poll was not my cup of tea a good controversial idea wasted but it was a interesting to see how a movie can be made with practically no money maybe if they had a bigger budget and a more experienced director this would have become a better movie,1,0
2653,i desperately want to give this movie a 10i really do some movies especially horror movies are so budget that they are good a wisecracking ninja scarecrow who can implement corn cobs as lethal weaponrydefinitely fits this budget to brilliance system the depth of the movie is definitely its strong point and the twists and turns it implements keeping the audience at the edge of their seats really drives the creepyninja pubertystricken prethirty year old studentnoncowboy drawingwisecrackingsonofabitch scarecrow into the limelight as the creepiest horror icon of the year all i can really say is can you dig it and recommend watching movies such as frankenfish if you enjoy this sort of hilarious horrorwhat the hell were they smoking,1,0
2674,love life explores a very culturally relevant scenario of a marriage of convenience between a lesbian and a gay man i found the subject matter compelling even if the conflict was a bit forced and too easily resolved for example thomas falls for joe a little too quickly and conveniently for the plot there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene in the end i found myself more turnedon by this movie than moved stephan d gill has a pretty nice body and shows it all quite a few times with pornstar skill and exuberance and alltoooften acting chops to match many times the movie seems like it is going to go fullon porn stephanie kirchen does a fine job but her moment of enlightenment at the end was sullied a bit for me since i was in the mood for a good romp in the shower by the end of this movie,1,0

2689,it has its merits morvern callar is both the merits and the disappointments shes so enigmatic so original is it her method of dealing with the pain of a lost one thats making her so distant and unrelatable or is she as one reviewer called her a revolutionary personally id call her dysfunctionalmorvern is completely detaching herself disposing of her boyfriend not thinking of informing family or using the money he gave her for a proper funeral she selfishly splashes out on a trip to spain shes seems so devoid of anything relatively human bar greed the only element that enables the audience see the human side of her is her close friend she takes on holiday with her although by the end her friend is dumped and morvern has nothing that ties her down to humanity she may as well have killed herselfdespite managing to make spain look as gloomy and bland as the uk the directors shots were superb the lighting and color made the film visually stunningits really a shame the movie has nothing in it that keeps interest its little over 90 minutes but feels a lot longer they manage to make morvern seem interesting to grab your attention but do nothing with her only alienate her from you more to the point where you dont care about the characters or the film,1,0
2691,ive read just about every major book about the manhattan project most people know what it was but few people understand the depth and breadth of the project its scope was immeasurably massive rivaled in us history perhaps only by the space program of the 1960sthere were literally millions of people involved from all walks of life at numerous sites most clandestine around the country each involved in a specific and different aspect of the project that they couldnt talk about to the person sitting in the cubicle next to them much less their family the logistics are overwhelming particularly given the considerations of wartime communication security and transportation in the 1940sas an example my colleagues father was a carpenter who worked for one of the companies that had a contract with the federal government for the manhattan project his job was to supervise a crew of about 30 other carpenters who were responsible for manufacturing forms for the pouring of concrete for the massive research installations at hanford washington thats all he did six days a week for nearly two years these carpenters needed food housing sanitary facilities hospitals and materials just as much as did oppenheimer and his crowd at the top of the pyramid just think about it that being said its simply impossible to do the subject justice in a 2hour movie in defense of joffe however i would say that they had an impossible task particularly since he chose to have a diverse screenplay with multiple plots multiple angles and multiple characters what exactly was he thinking and how could he be so arrogant to think that this would work thats hollywood i guessfat man and little boy has so many flaws that it would take a book to list them all horrible casting dreadful and politicallymotivated writing bad science the portrayals of groves and oppie are particularly inaccurate and downright galling notwithstanding the screenplays alltooobvious agenda it is still incredibly bland and sloppythese flaws have been listed elsewhere on imdb but i was particularly struck by the fact that the scientists had so much time on their hands softball horseback riding parties semiformal dinners ballet etc not to mention romance and of course circulating political petitions according to fmlb if these great brains had gotten off their duffs and actually spent some time in the lab instead of seducing laura dern we might have won the war before ddayone final gripe fmlb mentions that fat man and little boy were the code names of the two atomic bombs but it doesnt mention that these names were a semigoodnatured jab at groves fat man for heavy stature and oppenheimer little boy for his slight stature another reason paul newman should not have been in this movie,1,0
2700,i think this is one of those few movies that i want to rate it as low as possible just to pay it a complimenti havent seen this movie in about 25 years so i really cant say that much about it it still seems to be very hard to find on video but i remember my brother and i stumbled upon it somewhere in the toxic brew of late night uhf channel television of the mid 1980s when i was about 10 years old so ive never actually seen the beginning of the movie but i saw most of it the first thing i remember is this couple is sneaking out of a campsite and theyre rowing to an island to make out and then they get attacked by an insane scotsman in a kilt with an axe they manage to escape from him but get attacked by the loch ness monster which in this movie is just a head and a neck with no body the eyes and the mouth of the monster dont even move it looks like a piatai mean i had just literally never seen anything on this magnitude before and it totally blew my mind i had seen some bad movies on tv in the early 80s but i had never seen something so totally inept and so casually and thoughtlessly constructed that it seemed like the people who made it spent less time and effort on it than we did watching it i had already seen some of the troma films and that type of thing that tries to deliberately be campy but this was the pure and real stuff and it was my first encounter with truly great bad filmmaking this movie was like the last gasp of the drivein era and i caught a whiff of it just in time actually when we were watching it we couldnt figure out if it was made in the 50s or the 70s turns out it came out just a few years before i saw itlater i came into contact with mystery science theater and found out about a lot of the old b movies and serials but i had already seen it in this movie the movie is so funny that i had never even laughed that hard at the monty python crew or bill murray or any comedian after seeing this movie i was always trying to search for the good bad movies and i got a lot of my friends into it but this movie was and basically is an impossible one to find i never really found out what it even was or who larry buchanan was until the 1990s when imdb took off and the internet took off and information started getting passed around but this movie still needs to be discovered by a lot of others who might appreciate its transcendentally bad qualities look for it,1,0
2707,welcome to our town welcome to your town as we are introduced into the worlds of its townsfolk of 1901 america this three act play is opened before us with the help of the stage manager a visual narrator if you like after his initial introductions we are lead into the homes of two particular families the webbs and the gibbsthis is most definitely middle america at the turn of the century and the progressive way of life of the american dream and its saccharine overtones that can seem a little biased in this dream town here we see the everyday lives of some of its 2642 populace of grovers corners new hampshire even if there are too the migrant polish workers that add another 500 to is numbers they never get a lookinonce the daily lives of these families have been introduced wives cooking children homeworking fathers working kids falling in love and the clean picketfences painted white the second act is started three years later after young george a young and unrecognisable william holden then aged 22 and emily have fallen in love and intend to marry blossoming lovebirds reaching for the stars and reaching too a turning point in their own lives from the nest they lived and now into the anxieties and woes of young adulthood they nervously step the third act is slightly more sour and foreboding it is in this act that the movies intentions become apparent here we see not life not celebration but death and it is in this predicament that the dead as they return to revisit and reconcile their own life past are here to remind us to tell us that life and every last minute every precious breath is not to be wasted and squanderedit is in this last third that the movies own political stance also seems more apparent too feeling more of a propaganda stunt on the moral lecturing on and by middle america and how it should direct its home and how it should also put it in order this isnt just about our town this is moral diction aimed at our souls and how america can better itself if its peoples excluding the poles the irish the native american and the freed ethnic minorities and minorities in general plus the supporting backbone of the americanas who still have not had a fair part in this narrative such as the middle classes can live up to the expectations of the american dream through honest decent living the purveyors of the american dream with special invitation onlyi was entertained slightly by this movie too but i felt that its narrative held a stronger impact than anything else that took part in it albeit the bland acting the musical score or how well or not it was made this was the movies intention to exclude other groups and to only include the likes of the webbs and the gibbs in the future of the developing country of the usa a good movie but also a slightly biased in its stance i thoughttaken from the play by us born thornton wilder 1897 1975 this pulitzer prize winning play and six academy award nominated movie was the focal point on the perpetual motion of life and its three main attributes life love and death the plays translation onto celluloid comes across as a slightly to the right blurb of social consciousness our town starts off with what seems a lesson in pointlessness like other towns nothing too exciting ever happens here if anything at all this town only has the right sort of people you can still leave your backdoor unlocked here we are seeing the developing lives of these two families but it is their moral and social stance that is more important than them themselves our town may just have been any town just as long as you came from the right part of town that is,1,0

2799,casting aside many of the favorable comments that have obviously come from friends andor relatives that pepper this and many other low budget independents listed on imdb one is lost when it comes to using these reviews as an accurate gauge so eventually you have to go out and rent the flick just to see for yourself one of the first things you must understand are the catch phrases that camouflage the reality of the movie in this case the term dark psychological thriller read hack writerdirector who thinks hes an auteur who replaces plot story and action with what he believes is a deep insight into the human soul his great insight festering and repressed childhood traumas emerge to wreck havoc when we become adults wow i bet freud would be really impressed too many would be film makers like kallio who were raised on low budget horror flicks of the last few decades fail to dig their own fresh grave instead they fall into the predug graves of the many other directors that came before them they are content with rehashing old and tired horror clichs that they borrowed from a dozen or more films the result is an unoriginal uninspired unbelievable waste of film stock,1,0
2805,there is nothing good to say about this movie read revolution for the hell of it or any of his other writings abbie was often dismissed as the clownprince of the 60s but he was a man of ideas who used his cleverness his sense of humor and pop culture and his flamboyant personality to get attention to his ideas the media too often concentrated on the man not the ideas and thats the problem with this movie too later in his life he did suffer from depression but this flick is like a national enquirer version of abbie he deserves better if you dont know abbie or his times this movie wont help this film lies i give it a zero,1,0
2806,it is extremely rare that i see a movie from 1955 that i dont love noir jds scifi driveins i dig it all the most robert aldrich is a director who has done plenty of excellent work and most of this cast has fine performances under their belt so what went wrongwhen i used to work in the independent film world we used to talk about something called actors movies actors movies are movies that are unwatchable to anyone but other actors actors like actors movies because they get to see acting which is to say completely overthetop melodrama actors love to be given the chance to totally let loose give it all theyve got and they get a great satisfaction from watching other actors do so in many interviews with actors they say he was a great director he never interfered with me in any way actually thats the opposite of good directing because the whole point of having a director on the set is to keep the actors from making fools of themselves which given the chance they will always doapparently robert aldrich forgot that on this project or maybe he was ill or maybe he thought there was no hope for saving the script in the first place so what the heck whatever the case here is an example of a lesserknown movie that is best forgotten the characters gesticulate pontificate and generally ham it up all the way through one thing i can say is realistic its set in hollywood and everyone acts like their petty problems are the most important thing in the world doesnt make it fun to watch but it is realistic what isnt realistic is that a producer so desperate to keep his star under contract is going to go out of his way to antagonize him in almost every conceivable way including requiring him to engage in illegal activity but this and other plot contradictions merely carry along the melodrama increasing the opportunity for handwringing and shouted accusations i did manage to get to the end of this film which makes it no worse than a 3 out of 10 in my book but why test your own endurance when there is so much else available to rent,1,0

2859,how much do i love this film now im not a fan of bad films but i do love a film that is so bad its good this is one of those juan pablo di pace has a great butt looks fab on screen and definitely doesnt make a bad turn at his acting debut i believe billy zane is suitably mean and moody though i still constantly feel that there is something more in him i felt it in titanic the look on his face when la winslet spat on him for example totally broken shocked and putdown fierce kelly brook is a pretty face no seriously i think thats it its worth catching this to see one really hot guy some big bra fillers from brook nasty growling from billy laugh at the dialogue revel in the scenery and madness of the whole affair im gona go watch it again now yes i bought it,1,0
2864,heres the good news first spirit is the most visually incredible animated film in current home theater release the artwork and effects are revolutionary and i recommend that you give this movie a look by virtue of the visuals aloneand now for the bad news i really mean it when i say that the animation is the only thing this movie has going for it you may remember that spirit got badly trounced by lilo and stitch last summer the first person who argues that it was because disney is more wellestablished and had better advertising can write me a four page long essay entitled why lilo and stitchs script didnt stinkfor all the incredible new animation technology on display in spirit the story is almost astonishingly dull there is a lesson here and needless to say it doesnt just apply to animated movies you can have the most mindblowing visual effects ever to grace the eyes of a mortal but if your story is boring and more importantly we dont care about your characters its bad filmmaking simple as that the animation is still mindblowing i just cant wait to see what somebody with more imagination does with it,1,0
2894,this film was produced and released as a successor to a ghastly although fairly popular slapstick californian beach comedy called hardbodies but it has little or no connection with the earlier film and is better assessed completely in its own right it is certainly better than hardbodies i and is more closely related to films such as venus and summer lovers which were also filmed during summer in the greek islands the combination of blissful beaches on blue bays with beautiful bare bosoms makes for seductive viewing but except for travelogues just designed to help plan your next holiday even such films require an adequate story line if they are to hold a viewers attention for more than a very few minutes venus was underpinned by the legend of the reincarnation of the goddess and summer lovers had the viability of a menage a trois as its theme in my view both these films were much more successful than hardbodies ii which has a very tenuous story line and depends too much on simplistic semislapstick comedy the use of slapstick quickly becomes tedious it usually leads to a series of very short self contained cameo sequences that are hard to integrate into an ongoing story line mel brooks achieved this brilliantly with silent movie but few other films have succeeded in the same way and hardbodies ii unfortunately does not there is also the problem that the slapstick sequences do not cohabit happily with the idyllic and peaceful scenario in which the film is set the final airport sequences were no doubt intended to provide a hilarious ending for this film but in my opinion they are an example of the worst type of overplayed slapstick pseudocomedy they are also grossly overlong so i left the cinema with a bad taste left in my mouth this is a film which could have been much more successful with a stronger story line and with most of its slapstick sequences very heavily pruned as it was released it certainly does not warrant a viewers rating higher than 3 there is little memorable in the acting but the cast does its best within the limitations imposed by a meagre story line and poor direction it is in these latter areas that the failure arises,1,0
2916,im writing this note as a chess player as well as as a movie viewer i watched the 1997 kasparovdeep blue games on the internet i know something about the issues that were raised other chess players will come along and want to know whether this movie is worth seeingbuying and im talking largely to them however ill try not to ignore those who arent into chessthis movie is about the 1997 match between garry kasparov and the custombuilt computer deep blue however the first image you see in the movie is not of kasparov or of the computer but of the turk this is an automaton which was built in europe at the turn of the 18th19th century and played winning chess against all comers i put the word automaton in quotes because it was as everyone now knows a fake there was a man inside itif you dont like seeing the turk then you wont be able to stand the movie because the turk has as much screen time as kasparov maybe more both in modern footage and in bw footage from some old movie the reappearance of the turk every few seconds underscores kasparovs charge that deep blue had human assistance that it was to some degree a fake computer that ibm cheated that there was a man inside it working behind the scenes to help it win not only does kasparov believe this but the filmmakers seem to believe it too and so this is not really much of a movie about chess games or about programming chess computers it is a propaganda piece about a big corporation supposedly misusing a helpless grandmaster really it is a lot like a negative campaign ad as it is chock full of ominous music and evocative camera work and spooky sound effects and innuendos we never found out what was behind that locked door and the everpresent turknow most people in the chess community are pretty much convinced that ibm did not cheat and that this was garrys paranoia at work to start with in order for a human to help deep blue beat kasparov it would seem that you would need a human who was better than deep blue and better than kasparov since there was no such person the whole idea is a bit suspect from the start furthermore by the time this movie was made there were computer programs that could run on your pc that could beat strong grandmasters today much more than in 1997 we take it for granted that a computer can do things you might not expect and we are less likely to take it as a monumental human tragedy that a computer beat a guy in chess and in fact the bottom line is that kasparov beat himself with two bad mistakes including resigning game 2 in a drawn position as for the chess games you actually see very little of them there are a few comments from masters and commentators that tell briefly how they went but really you dont get to see hardly any of the strategy or tactics at all naturally as a chess player i take this as a major shortcoming but i think that nonplayers are being cheated too imagine a baseball movie for example where you dont hardly get to see any of the game just a commentator telling you that in game four the white sox defeated the astros with such and such a score nobody would make a movie like that but here for example we are told that kasparov made a bad blunder in the opening of the decisive game 6 but we arent shown the position on the screen or told why it was a blunder or what he should have done instead or anything we just see a few seconds of kasparov holding his head in his hands and then more atmospheric sound effects and camera worksince i saw this on dvd let me warn chess players about the dvd as well the jacket promises you that the extras include the games with analysis is this grandmaster analysis which people like us might find interesting no it is the automated computer voice synthesizer analysis from some version of chessmaster that tells you when a piece is attacked and a pawn gets isolated and that you are in the carokann defense main line blahhhh someone might then come along and say well clearly this movie is meant to dramatize the match for the nonplayer and so its unfair to be impatient with it but actually it doesnt do a very good job of reaching out to the nonplayer either it skates over some points that a true novice would really want to have explained for example it says that kasparov could have gotten perpetual check in the second game but it doesnt explain what that is or show what it would have looked like on the board which would have been interesting it flashes back to the kasparovkarpov matches but doesnt explain why there were two of them or who organized them etc i didnt need this information myself but im familiar with it if you dont already have chess experience there are places where you are going to be confused and this is just a defect in the filmultimately i cant recommend the movie which like the turk itself is not what it purports to be a documentary but more of a stage illusion,1,0
2921,having read some good reviews about this film i thought it was about time i go and see it well i dont know why i bothered basically this family is entrusted with a clue that leads to a whole big stash of ancient treasure hidden by the knights templar during the war of independence apparently it had to be kept out of the hands of the british at all costs firstly why did said knights move the treasure from europe to america how did nic cages character figure out that charlotte was in fact a ship how do they figure out all the clues and riddles in about a minute and how could two people suddenly become master thieves and steal what is probably the best guarded bit of paper in the world these are just some of the plot holes in this inane bit of hollywood action gone wrong cage has been in some great action movies faceoff and the rock so why has he lowered himself to this is he getting too old his character is pretty annoying really somehow this ordinary guy steals the declaration of independancd outruns thieves with guns escapes from the fbi and generally seems invincible the whole film doesnt really make any sense and all in all it was quite a disappointment,1,0
2928,whether any indictment was intended must be taken into consideration if in the year 2000 there were still rifts of feeling between caucasian and afroamericans in georgia such as shown in this film obviously there remains a somewhat backward mentality among a lot of people out there it is rather hypocritical to say the least if everyone adores halle berry whoopie goldberg beyonc noemi campbell denzel washington will smith et al whilst out in the backs there persist manifest racial divideswhite grandmother suddenly gets black granddaughter thrust upon her only to meet up with black grandfather in a very white social backwater the story is sweet not lacking tragic overtones and eminently predictable as in most of these kinds of tv films though the final scene has you guessing will he wont hegena rowlands in her typical style offers a sincere rendering and louis gossett is a good match for her the little penny bae fortunately does not steal the showa nice way of relaxing after sunday lunch without having to force your mind too much though you might just find yourself having a little siesta in the middle of it,1,0
2930,major payne is a film about a major who makes life a living hell for his small group of boys in the marines this film does not really have a lot to offer but it provides several hilarious moments that are wellworth a watch dont expect it to be a memorable film however just expect to laugh your way through the film and at the expense of other people the confrontation between major payne and the chubby boy were hilarious and thats really all i remember about the film except for the boys wanting revenge on major payne again it is not a great film and it is probably best watched on a rainy day when you need some laughter,1,0

2966,this movie wasnt too funny it wasnt too horrible either just a fun ride aboard the soul plane its a blackowned flight service with a kickass disco beautiful bar and pumping stewards the plot takes you through the whole idea of a black not race or color but style owned plane with the same style of black humor at times there are some great rare scenes like when the main character uses the normal lavatory in the normal plane check that out there are lulls however and i find it most in the character who played the soul pilot watch to find out who it is all in all its a fun movie tom arnold adds to the fun with his cracker attitude this is one movie to watch when playing poker when youre drunk or just vegging,1,0
2983,i dont give much credence to aids conspiracy theories but its sociologically interesting to see the phenomenon dramatized in the early years of the aids epidemic the suffering and paranoia of the scared and dying often generated such dark fantasies this was especially true in the politically radical and sexually extreme demimonde of san francisco the city renowned for its beauty has rarely appeared uglier than in this film a sense of darkness and decomposition pervades every scenewhile the acting and plot cant be said to be welldone the films unique cultural context and oppressively dark mood at least partly saves the film from being a complete loss actually i found the most interesting performance to be irit levi as a crusty and cynical jewish lesbian police detective shes interesting though not necessarily convincinghighlights the films use of the garishly tragic turandot is an effective motif and there is a sublime silent cameo by iconic performance artist ron athey,1,0

3003,first off i want to say that this film is worthy of more than the four stars i rated it i gave it four stars because for me this 86 minute movie always seems like 2 and a half hours and is not engaging enough to sit through it all however the big alligator river the title my dvd calls it is better than your average nature strikes back moviea tourist resort in the jungles of southeast asia is just opening and employs the natives while trying to manipulate the wildlife around mother nature seeking revenge comes in the form of the god kroona a giant alligator but the creature isnt the only thing the tourists and the main characters a photographer and the resort staff have to worry about the natives are getting rubbed the wrong way toothis movie is a pretty welldone adventurehorror story with a good musical score and direction but the alligator itself the main attraction of the movie is obviously fake looking some of the closeups of its jaws are good but that should be all we need to see some of the underwater faraway shots make it painfully obvious that what we are really dealing with is an alligator squeakytoy you can probably get at a zoo souvenir shop but the natives are believable if not authenticprobably not the movie that will give you nonstop thrills if any but shot and produced well enough to be given good mention and like a lot of creature movies this one ends with an extremely high body count it also has lots of good jungle scenery acting is below par though but who was expecting it to be better eh much much better than its recent american counterpart primeival but nothing to be compared with jaws but remember it may not be engaging at a few points,1,0

3060,david h steinbergs script seemed initially having some real smart points that couldve made good romantic comedy but but but oh dear what did ever happen in the way ill tell you what happened originally its animal house 1978 and porkys 1982 although that was long time ago but those are the pioneers the godfathers of the new genre the crude teen comedy then the 1990s came after important instances that became smash hits repulsive ones am i add such as problem child 1990 dumb and dumber 1994 the nutty professor 1996 and theres something about mary 1998 which i think slackers is affected by there was the top of the era and the prophet of the next era the one and only american pie 1999 whichs undoubtedly and incomparably a genres icon after that i think every comedy of that kind got to be that highly filthy cum laude nasty to be admired by the youth otherwise it might be out of fashion i believe that slackers had a smart plot first as a script then its makers got to add some real big amount of rudeness filthiness strangely shameless sex to be made at those days as easy as pie like they had to fill every scene with freely elements such as masturbation oral sex urination etc just to look a la mode theyre wholly unnecessary elements to the story but surely they are so necessary to make the profits and to catch the latest vogue in making teen comedies the problem is in how all of that has replaced already any possible comedy in itsome of its moments looked literally horrible and that as you see is the point its all in jason schwartzmans looks and performance memorably disgusting to the utmost so the ambition transformed from being that romantic comedy into making what wasnt done before of pure skinning images to be more like a horror where youre asking all the time what nastier would happen vomiting farting etc these are the easiest combination to create a comedy nowadaysthough even if you hated it youve got to love something mostly for being bold for me it was only gina gershon cameos scene anyhow they designed it as a whole to achieve being outragesforoutrageousness like an adolescents naughty dream though the majority of it was near to anybodys nightmarewhat made me sad is that this one at its core was a real potential work and not another cheap another stupid comedy as it eventually managed to be remember well the details of stealing the exam the first 2 minutes so the movies main plot weirdo trying to reach a girl by blackmailing cool guys through the pattern of boy loves girl and girl loves another boy because save that its nothing but a candidly schlock it dealt with its material the tacky way bunch of dirty college boys who got nothing to do but making mawkish quip out of anything would do it ended up as being and im sorry to say it a smiling sht at its end it said something can you imagine about how its the time and the place too for the impostor or the slack to win totally like this comedy itself it sounds good ending yet for totally another better movie which could assure my opinion about this one as smart one once and it doesnt need much to understand that this movies makers were the real slackers maybe being stupid is a way to be smart in hollywood but even if the final result here wasnt at least witty by any sense of the word ps its scriptwriter david h steinberg who wrote the story of american pie 2 as well has a main page at the imdb where youll find under the additional details his usual plot keywords which are sex vulgarity crude humor they just forgot to write urineing while showering or baring 70 year old women,1,0

3154,the highlight of this movie for me was without doubt tom hanks as mike sullivan he was definitely cast against type and showed that he can handle an untraditional for him role hanks is usually the good guy in a movie the one you like admire and root for sullivan was definitely not a good guy its true that in the context of this movie he came across as somewhat noble his purpose being to avenge the murders of his wife and youngest son even so he was already a gangster and murderer before those killings so hanks took a role i wouldnt have expected him in and he pulled it off wellhanks good performance aside though i certainly couldnt call this an enjoyable movie after an opening that i would best describe as enigmatic it wasnt entirely clear to me for a while where this was going it turns into a very sombre movie about the complicated relationships sullivan has developed as a gangster largely raised by rooney paul newman whos a sort of mob boss and trying to raise his own two sons and to keep them clean so to speak isolated from his business after the older son witnesses a murder the gang tries to kill him to keep him quiet gets the wrong son and the mother and leaves sullivan and his older son mike jr on the run it becomes a weird sort of fatherson bonding moviealthough it ends on a somewhat hopeful note at least in the overall context of the story its really very dark throughout that mood being reinforced with many of the scenes being shot in darkness and torrential rainfall i have to confess that while i appreciated hanks performance the movie as a whole just didnt pull me in 410,1,0

3235,a huge hit upon release with australian audiences it can still be funny today but its overthetop political incorrectness and blunt unsubtle humour can make it a bit of a cringer it goes on far too long some of the content could have been saved for the sequel barry mckenzie holds his own which desperately needed some new stuff anyway granted his ocker aussie attitude is funny but also becomes annoying as the film drags on some say crockers songs are the best bits and they are certainly original but hilarious the adventures of barry mckenzie will go down as a landmark in australian cinema but we should do everything in our power to make sure that overseas audiences do not see the majority of australians as barry mckenzies or for that matter mick dundees rating 510,1,0
3267,the original thunderbirds earned a place in tv history it was and still is much beloved indeed the entire first 10 minutes of the wallace and gromit movie the wererabbit is a direct lift of thunderbirds down to a direct replay of the original thunderbird 2 launching sequence if you dont believe me get the movie and then get a copy of the original episode where thunderbird 2 is launchedthis movie was a crass attempt at making a kids movie when the original was loved and enjoyed by kids and adults alike in the original the thunderbirds spent all of their time rescuing people who were often trapped when mother nature or technology went horrible wrong yes there was also the occasional criminal act the thunderbirds put their own lives and resources at risk for no reward the very essence of heroism and selflessness there was little physical violence the thunderbirds challenged the imagination to a degree how many of us would dream of someday building a thunderbird 2 and dont underestimate the power of entertainment to do this many japanese attribute their fascination with humanoid robots to the old astroboy cartoonbut this movie was a poor reimage of the original this movie came across as a meld between thunderbirds and loony tunes i mean we have anthony edwards as brain imitating porky pigs stuttering much of the action consists of kung fupower rangers type fighting indeed there were funny sound effects when someone got nailed on the head with a frying pan the tech that fired our imagination was absent instead we have these kids running around using a plot device that was never in the original series having the entire team take off at once leaving the base occupied by the kids and brain then there was a dose of use the force luke mysticism thrown in when tintin would levitate something or another coupled with the the hood using aerodynamics that looked like they were lifted from crouching tiger hidden dragon about the only thing missing was for the hood to go tintin i am your uncle with a breath mask voice the heart that made thunderbirds unique was gonethe only bright point was ron cooks portrayal of parker he caught it perfectly but the actress playing lady penelope came across as a child huh and this is why we hate this movie when someone puts out something that was popular to a fan base and expects the fans to shell out money to watch and then delivers something than wasnt even close to what the fans expect well i am sorry that is just plain wrong ok so if they were making a kids movie fine next time distribute it straight to video where many of these belong but dont package something up in a familiar wrapper and change the innards,1,0

3311,i dont really know whether cabin fever is supposed to be a joke or a film but as far as i know its much closer to being a joke than anything else a few years ago the community of horror film makers decided to take a new step and make fun of the genre thus giving birth to the scream series a list was given in scream of all the stupid things horror film characters will do that are predictable and the characters in scream ended up doing exactly the same things which added a lot of humor and irony to this analysis of the genre and led to hope that horror films from now on would show a bit different either full of irony towards the genre selfderision towards the film itself or at least different in their dramatic process than all the old films that responded to the same tired criteria in seeing cabin fever alas many will see how unoriginal serious pretentious boring and even not scary some supposedly scary films are now even a few years later first of all this film lacks originality in a way few others do it has been said several times how little imagination horror directors have today remaking remakes of foreign sequels but setting the film in a cabin in the woods just doesnt seem to be an hommage to anything it seems to be simply a ripoff whoever wishes to be surprised by other factors of the films story wont be once again we are dealing with a film whose characters are all in their early twenties who wont think rationally when placed in front of a problem will rather argue for hours and pick up fights than try to think and do something about it not much excitement there either for the umpteenth time in a horror film they are tempted to kiss make love and just basically have fun all sorts of things that dont really make them any different than any other horror film victims seen previously secondly this film is unimaginatively serious every situation the characters are in every dialog every situation in the film is treated with such seriousness that any viewer with a little sense of derision will be relieved when some characters finally end up dying nothing in the way the film is directed written or acted shows any sign of humor or sarcasm which is quite amazing considering the film is about an invisibleneverheardofbeforeflesheatingvirus no laughs please i wont even bring up the acting since there are no actors in this film the cast was most certainly hired for being friends or neighbors with the director thirdly and this will strike whoever has seen a good horror film before the screenplay is absolutely empty nothing really happens some actions are repeated several times lets try to get help nothing makes sense either in the facts the psychology of the characters or even the hilariously lame last sequence of the film which is probably supposed to be funny according to the director and screenwriters in the end i will only remark that a horror film is supposed to have something scary in it gallons of fake blood whether they are being vomited squirted from severed limbs or simply dripping from wounds never were enough to scare an audience such major features as screenplay ideas and even cruelty are requested for whoever claims to have shot something scary if i wasnt considering it to be a total failure i would agree to reckon that the film has one talent it is filthy disgusting to watch yet being grossedout and being scared are two very different feelings let it be knowni would like to encourage anyone a tad curious or interested in seeing this film to check older major horror films first why not from the 60s the 70s the 80s films made by wes craven dario argento sam raimi stanley kubrick david lynch roger corman william lustig john carpenter it might not only give a good definition of what is scary or selfderisory horror but also convince viewers that new isnt necessarily better a good example related to the film is the few tracks composer angelo badalamenti provided for this film even although they are unmistakably close to his previous compositions they are below anything he has ever done before,1,0

3353,wow not only is this film a new lesson in real bad taste but also a lesson in real bad film making dont get me wrong i appreciated the concept of zombie 90 extreme pestilence but at the same time one must realize when a movie is terrible in case you missed out on the storyline the plot of zombie 90 is about a government plane carrying toxic chemicals that so happens to crash into the wilderness causing the chemicals to spill turning locals into hideous looking zombies the next thing you know zombies are all over the city eating people alive while a goofylooking doctor and a government agent are trying to figure out the disease thats making these people eat one another hence the name extreme pestilence from then on all we see is zombies having a field day on every local in sight nothing but extreme and sickening disembowelments and dismemberments accompanied by endless buckets of guts and gore since this is a german film the film had to be dubbed into english and when youre not laughing at the feeding frenzies of the zombies the voiceovers are quite hilarious and entertaining as well as user unratedx mentioned spoiler spoiler spoiler there is a scene in the film that crosses the line between whats acceptable and not acceptable hence the scene in which a woman who is carrying her infant baby is being wheeled around in her wheelchair by some dude and a horde of zombies come out of nowhere and attack them one zombie grabs the baby and rips it into pieces eating its organs as you hear the baby crying wow that is a new lesson in reallllllllly bad taste atrocious i tell you atrocious,1,0
3399,welli like patricia kaas she is a beautiful lady and an extremely gifted and versatile singer her acting in this film is more than competent and from my point of view about the only redeeming feauture of this film she very gently captures the essence of the lonely singer with a very serious helath problem however what i tremendously dislike about the film is the shameless product placement for a well known french chain of hotels the other thing is that the story seems to meander for way to long without really deciding what the film is about and what it wants to be on a positive note you may argue that the film is not predictable but you could also say its plainly boring because of the lack of cohesion there are some nice shots in the film bujt you cant help thinking that all the parts just dont add up to anything at all it really is a pity bevcause kaas really shines in this film,1,0
3403,after watching this film i thought to myself they really glossed up errol flynns life the movie is really nice eye candy they really got the 1930s and 1940s atmosphere of hollywood just right the costumes were great all the women looked glamorous and all the men looked handsome and debonairis this a serious film about errol flynns life nah its a fun movie based on all the scandalous stuff he did in his lifewhy am i critiquing this film this is a film that had a lot of promise but failed to deliver duncan reagher was really good as errol flynn he was not as good looking as the original but he made you believe that flynn was not just a handsome playboy who did not take himself seriously but as a man who although gifted with great talent was kind of disturbed and unhappy inside flynns love life was a disaster considering he had so many failed marriages he also lost a lot of good friends during his life he also suffered from unrequited love for the elegant olivia dehavilland the last scene of the film showed errol kind of begging for olivia to stay with him and instead she walks away he is shown in his tux looking really empty and slowly walking around the pool as he pours his drink into the pool it was a sad way to end the film but kind of fitting because everyone knows by now how he eventually fell apart from his alcoholism and his dissipated lifestylethis film couldve had much more depth couldve been better wellwritten sure they showed all the scandals but they never showed errol flynns human center surprisingly duncan reagher was able to put some emotional depth into the character of errol flynn even though the film writing didnt put any depth thereill probably never see this film again but i can still remember after viewing this film gosh this couldve been so much more i give this film a d,1,0

3600,when family guy first premiered i was not in a discriminating mood with the 1990s containing a wealth of clever surreal cartoons why should i be nickelodeon produced doug ren and stimpy and rockos modern life among other fine cartoonsyes this includes spongeboball had quirky dreamlike animation and surprisingly sophisticated stories and dialog the simpsons became an outright phenomenon perhaps not as brilliant as its biggest defenders claim it to be but a very fine investment of your time and certainly dismisses the false axiom that all tv is junk south park started out as a crude but hilarious attack on everything with unique and intelligent satire underneath it evolved to become a monty python esquire show with outrageous concepts and brutally swift and sharp societal critiquessuch as their defense of the noble underpants gnomes and eventually settled to be entirely self referential and meta like the simpsons did and has unfortunately jumped the shark family guy is superficially like the simpsons and south park it pushes buttons and is a favorite among college students and bestiality enthusiasts however what it has in loquacity it lacks in true witthe show is famous for its use of gimmicks especially for flashbacks many are references to bad tv sitcoms or commercials some are funnyespecially from the first two seasons most are not are references inherently funny im not sure but they are mostly what the show stands on considering that its characters are painfully uninteresting where homer and bart have charm and cartman has an artillery of self awareness and pure outrageousness to back up his awful behavior peter griffin has no excuse hes just a loud obnoxious pig anything funny coming from his character is only because the writers forget how to be unfunny that day lois is also very shallow and dull meg is a prop only to be abused chris is borderline retarded and only occasionally funny and the two main stars of the showstewie and brian are so inconsistent in their characterizations that it all really kind of pointlessother gimmicks i cant stand are when a character points to something obviously and lingers on it for an uncomfortably long time this happens a lot lately and i cant bear it any longer not just the oft mentioned chicken that likes to beat peter up im talking about the painful moments where they talk about pop culture and prod it as if they are alien spectators thats not wit or even ironic humor its totally boring and lifelessnot that the show cant be funny in fact some of the earlier episodes had me rolling highlights include the pilot episode where peter loses touch with reality after losing his precious television when peters religious zealot father shows up and wreaks havoc when peter becomes a narc at megs school and the pancake episode i suspect these are the episodes that accidentally incorporated actual human traits in its characters or merely were times the writers had actual comedic inspirationone last thing the show is not offensive its only offensive to those who wouldnt watch the show in the first place so its almost like a circle jerk to the choir of hipsters,1,0
3606,we all know that some of the greatest movies of all time were based on books while not particularly accurate adaptations these movies were nonetheless excellent films some great examples are the harry potter series the lord of the rings trilogy and to a lesser extent almost every disney film ever made however i must regretfully announce that a wrinkle in time is not one of those movies not only does it fail to meet some of the most basic expectations of madeleine lengles fan base it manages to defy the standards of scriptwriting acting special effects and ultimately respect for the audience mind you im not trying to be mean on the contrary i went into this affair with an open mind i figured that a madefortv movie would make up for its lack of razzledazzle in its script after all the star wars spinoff ewoks was decent if a little silly come to think of it the original star wars was made on a lunch money budget and look where it took george lucas however from the first scene onward disappointment started enveloping me as if id gotten too close to the black thing while tessering the same way greedo shooting first became the symbol of the star wars special edition of 1997 a disaster of monumental proportions involving a disgruntled director making several hideous changes to a beloved classic mrs whatsit has officially become my personal symbol for the confusion and stupidity that is a wrinkle in time the reason for this is the fact that she has been mutated beyond belief aside from the slightly controversial decision of casting alfre woodard star trek first contact and radio as our favorite starturnedmentor the filmmakers decided it appropriate to introduce her as a crow thats right a crow moreover the heavenly centaurion form of this greatly beloved character has been hacked at by what looks to be a demented eightyearold the majestic halfman halfhorse with wings has become a huge human head with a creepy smile mounted awkwardly on the bowlegged body of a horse that happens to be sporting a pair of wings in the middle had i been five this would have psychologically traumatized me for life the worst part is the fact that when it spoke it was shown from behind so as to avoid the responsibility to lip sync resulting in a scene that was spent looking at the back of its head and seeing a single unmoving cheek thus rendering the piece of special effects less believable than ethaving gotten the most painful part out of the way i must go on to the tearinducing one the characters the acting and the story i personally had always imagined meg to look somewhat similar to moaning myrtle from the harry potter films plain hair glasses and a figure most supermodels would find laughable she was always a slightly anxious humorously pessimistic math genius who quite simply could not have cared less about the imports and exports of nicaragua in the film she is an unpleasant knowitall for whom i have no sympathy whatsoever in fact she makes me feel sorry for poor mr jenkins her school principal who continuously has to deal with her calvin the kind intelligent kid who everyone thinks is a jock has become a jock the irony is horrible as for the memorable happy medium they took the pleasant old woman who liked to look at happy things and replaced her with a being who is above gender and likes to look at funny things such as girls falling off of swings the only three people i can think of who did a decent job are charles wallace mrs whatsit and the man with red eyes nicknamed the dude with red eyes due to his complete reinvention as a characterthe story is a mess a good comparison to this aspect of the movie is harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban which didnt do a good job of retelling the story found in the book yet kept the sole of the original work here the sole of the book is having a pleasant chat with hades down in the underworld apparently unaware that its body is being destroyed as the dark lord complements the sole on how well it showed that truth has to be felt and not seen the flatnosed wookies of ixchel who replace the wondrous beings who hold aunt beast among their ranks tear the spine up as the god of the dead notes how subtle the terror of the earthlike camazotz was the torn pages are scattered in the sandstorm and lost in the darkness of the land of evil i am very sorry that this film exists i do not believe that the actors were genuinely bad its the way the characters are written that ruins it a wrinkle in time deserved to be adapted by lawrence kasdan directed by george lucas or steven spielberg enhanced at industrial light and magic scored by john williams given its sound at skywalker sound edited by thx and marketed by twentieth century fox in its current state the film is unworthy to be shown to selfrespecting people even madeleine lengle thought it was bad the book was good the film was bad and mrs whatsit was uglyscore 0110 if i could prosthey got the names right cons it had horrible problems with the cliffs notes level of adaptation script acting and special effects not to mention lack of evidence of ever having read the book oh and the main coverposter has a picture of the three main characters riding a flying horse over a castle some might say that this symbolizes high adventure i say it symbolizes the irresponsibility of the cover artist who didnt even bother to photoshop megs arm on properly,1,0

3656,this is an interesting left turn for reel 13 indies two harbors is a bw 75 minute film from minnesota that features nonactors and is about two people finding a connection through a search for alien life i applaud the boldness of the reel 13 programmers of thinking outofthebox when selecting this film i just wish they had picked a stronger film to be bold with as a matter of fact i wonder if the choice had more to do with the uniqueness of the film than with the actual quality of the film itself not that two harbors is completely without merit but ill get to that a little later as is common with independent films two harbors is limited in terms of location there are only two real locations a large junk dealership market and a very teeny trailer which is the home of the middleaged main character vic played by alex cole writerdirector james vculek uses the market setting to provide exposition about vic who is one of the dealers there he has various people walk up to vic and start very long conversations that provides us with just two pieces of information vic sells space toys he prefers to call them outer space action figures and he is a caustic asshole this is emblematic of one of the two key problems with two harbors all the chatting ive said it before and ill say it again we are dealing with a visual medium and filmmakers need to work harder to tell their stories visually there are exceptions of course but generally endless patter is not so engaging on film particularly if the dialogue is being used as exposition pretty much all the conversations in the film are long and unnecessarily verbose a notable example would be a few scenes which feature vic trying to play himself off as a boy scout leader in order to get a discount at a store he argues with the clerk back and forth and these scenes dont even advance the plot one iota this is the kind of thing that makes even a 75 minute film feel longthe other problem with two harbors is the acting i may be a bit of a curmudgeon when it comes to performance in film but i really dont feel like theres a good excuse for not having good actors in your films there are plenty of good actors out there many of which willing to work on lowbudget projects even in minnesota many filmmakers eschew the importance of acting ability as being secondary to their visuals but that is nave in narrative filmmaking next to the story nothing is more important than the actingperformances if you dont believe the people enacting your story your audience is lostoriginally i thought vculek was using nonactors but as the film went on i decided that they were probably community theatertype actors it wasnt that they were uncomfortable on camera its that they were overly theatrical ie big granted the best of the actors were the two leads cole and catherine e johnson as cassie a lonely young girl that gets caught up in vics extraterrestrial hunt they seemed to have the most training but they were still a little rough around the edges the eccentricities they displayed seemed to be surface only not coming from a real organic place within ms johnson in particular is an interesting case she definitely has a presence a midwestern charm about her but that charisma belies the multitude of issues her character is supposed to have she struggles to portray the idiosyncrasies that stem from a supposed life of solitude and slave labor relying on stock gestures like eye rolls lip biting and stammering to suggest her discomfort with the outside worldi mentioned in the first paragraph that two harbors is not completely without merit and heres what i mean without giving too much away there is a fade to white an hour into the film after that the story takes a stunning turn which allows the last fifteen minutes to be evocative and downright powerful its like a sucker punch to the gut but in a good way its almost a huge relief to feel something after so long with these characters the last five minutes of the film dont have any dialogue at all and the result is the best part of the film subtle detailed cole does his best work of the film and most importantly cinematic then with the closing credits comes the most staggering revelation of all that its based on a true story which got me to thinking with all the dialogue the minimal locations and the lack of cinematic qualities it occurred to me that with two kick ass actors and a tightening rewrite two harbors might make a really kickass stage play maybe even a oneact if there are any bold theater producers out there reading this i definitely recommend seeing if you can get a hold of the film and contact the filmmaker reel 13 or whomever there might be something to this story after all for more information on this or any other reel 13 film check out their website at wwwreel13org,1,0
3660,one could wish that an idea as good as the invisible man would work better and be more carefully handled in the age of fantastic special effects but this is not the case the story the characters and finally the entire last 20 minutes of the film are about as fresh as a madscientist flick from the early 50s there are some great moments mostly due to the amazing special effects and to the very idea of an invisible man stalking the streets but alas soon were back in the cramped confinement of the underground lab which means that the rest of the film is not only predictable but schematicthere has been a great many remakes of old films or tv shows over the past 10 years and some of them have their charms but its becoming clearer and clearer for each film that the idea of putting ol classics under the noses of eager madmen like verhoeven who does have his moments is a very bad one it is obvious that the money is the key issue here the time and energy put into the script is nowhere near enough and as a result hollow man is seriously undermined with clichs sappy characters predictability and lack of any depth whatsoeverhowever the one thing that actually impressed me beside the special effects was the swearing when making this kind of film modern producers are very keen on allowing kids to see them therefore the language and sometimes the violence and sex is very toned down when the whole world blows up the good guys go oh darn and oh my god hollow man gratefully discards that kind of hypocrisy and the characters are at liberty to say what comes most natural to them im not saying that the most natural response to something gone wrong is to swear but it makes it more believable if someone actually swears i think we can thank verhoeven for that,1,0
3700,i am a huge fan of the first four juon projects i own them and watch them every few months i lend them to coworkers and friends just so they can get a good scare from quality japanese film making i think takashi shimizu created a great story and presented it very effectively in these four installmentsi was somewhat excited about the grudge 2 opening in theaters i saw the first american grudge before watching the four originals the grudge was actually pretty good of course the originals are better but i got a good halloween scare from the 2004 american grudgethe grudge 2 started off badly and went down from there i kept waiting for it to get better to make sense to show shimizus talent nothing like this happened the thing thats great about shimizus juon work is the story true its usually told in a disjointed style that you have to think about to connect its components but it is still a great story there was no story in the grudge 2 it was a series of gratuitous deaths from characters that you never had time to even start to care aboutthe editing was atrocious disjointed as in the japanese originals is one thing but the complete randomness of scene sequence was exhausting i just kept thinking this is so stupid and no he didnt really sell out this much did he it made me want to walk out of the theater run home and watch the original work simply to reassure myself that shimizu has not always made this dumbeddown generic boring nonsensical throwntogether tripeif you really have your heart set on seeing this movie i suggest you wait the 2 months to rent it really two of the five people in the theater with me walked out about 45 minutes into it i debated on whether to do that myself going home and cleaning the house actually sounded like a better way to spend my time at that pointi am truly shocked at how bad this movie was lets pray sam raimi doesnt put out more cash to make the grudge 3 its just not worth it anymore sigh,1,0
3703,this is another film i missed out on italian tv as a kid notable for its quintet of ageing stars most of whom had never made a horror film in their life fred astaire melvyn douglas douglas fairbanks jr john houseman and patricia neal it deals with the mens longconcealed past crime coming back to haunt them it takes the form of a ghostly deadringer for the girl they all loved alice krige but whom they were forced to dispose of after an unfortunate incident when she humiliated their egos fairbanks who was the one responsible for the deed has twin sons craig wasson and so krige directs her revenge upon them as well soon one of the latter fairbanks himself and even douglas and houseman all wind up dead therefore the remaining wasson and astaire decide to confront the ghost at the scene of the crime where they also have to contend with a couple of sinister tramps who somehow do kriges bidding i was looking forward to seeing these veterans on their last legs douglas died before the film had even premiered though by that time he had already completed another role while it proved astaires own inauspicious swansong but ghost story went through too many changes of mood while maintaining a sluggish pace throughout and emerging overlong into the bargain to be anything but a failed curio having dollops of sex including fullfrontal nudity from wasson and gruesome makeup effects muddled the waters all the more and marred the oldfashioned elegance inherent in jack cardiffs another notable of longstanding cinematography,1,0

3763,it figures this is a french film lol with the emphasis on young girls with much older menwhy is it the french are so fixated on this kind of thing when the age difference is this great it really comes off as pervy valentina cervi is beautiful she bears a strong resemblance to olivia hussey of zeffirellis 68 romeo and juliet set in a similar period but she looks about 15 and the actor playing tassi her painting instructor lookswell 50 is kindother posters have done the work of explaining the historical record unusually detailed in this case of the real artemisia a great artist and one of the earliest recognized female painters of this period 17th century her story speaks to us in modern times particularly because of the ageold accusation that all great artists were men she pretty much blasts that assertion to bits and because the story of her rape trial is so poignant not only was she clearly assaulted and forced into a degrading sexual relationship because in those days marriage to your assaulter was the only way to avoid social shame but tassi was a serial rapist and possibly killed his wife and childthe movie does a terrible disservice by inverting this truly fascinating and remarkable real life story very dramatic and not in need of any spicing up because in some weird frencified way its hotter to have an oversexed teenager drawing male sexual organs and having a hot love affair with a man old enough to be her grandfather thats sexy the truth is boring and seems too feministpolitically correctit also disturbs me that this is only part of artemisia life considered interesting enough to film the fact that she painted for decades her famous painting of judith beheading holfernes was painted after not before the rape that she was the first woman admitted to the prestigious florentine academy that she went on to have childrenoh thats boring stuff after all thats about a middle aged woman and they arent hot like teenagersi understand that there is a lot of creative license in making a film or a book about a real historical character you need to create dialog have subplots create dramatic structure certainly some details can be sacrificed its no big deal if the dates are moved a few years or if artemisia is played by a blonde actress when we know from her self portraits that she was a brunetteand a big boned one not a skinny minny or something like that but to turn her story around on her and make rape into a romance is actually sick and disturbing its even worse because the director is female she should be horribly ashamed of herselfif you like this and i know some people could care less about the real woman artist and just like period costumes and hot sex you will probably like dangerous beauty with rufus sewell and catherine mccormack similarly based on heavily rewritten history with lots of heaving bosoms and jewel encrusted goblets bon appetit,1,0
3769,this kiyoshi kurosawa ghost movie is pretty wild and it did have at least one jump scare that caught me off guard but all in all the movie is incredibly stupid with a detective trying to track down a suspected serial killer only to find out he may have committed one of the crimes then he finds himself haunted by a gorgeous asian lady ghost and has no idea why and neither does the viewer as other murders are committed he becomes even more confused as the killers are easily found and this ghost still haunts him for some reason not only is the plot completely stupid the lady ghost is more funny than anything especially when she suddenly flies across the city like wonder woman and the ending makes little sense in fact the whole movie makes little sense and i cant recommend it at all if it didnt take itself so serious i would think it was supposed to be a black comedy outside of bright future this is the worst movie directed by kiyoshi kurosawa i have seen yet,1,0
3780,spoiler this film gives away plot points and discusses the ending i hated this film mostly for political reasons but also for moral and aesthetic reasons politically this film glorified war and military technology blowing things up real good we are led to cheer as the music swells and the afghans use our weapons to blow the ruskies to bits and no us soldiers put their lives on the line so its a fun war aesthetically there isnt a touch of real human emotion in the film just smug privileged people being sarcastic feeling superior and doing whatever they want regardless of the consequences and speaking of consequences the film only makes a few small hits at what the arming of the afghans actually led to i had read an earlier draft of this script and it ended on 911 with charlie wilson realizing that things had gone horribly wrong but that wouldnt leave the audience feeling good this is a feel good movie about killing ruskies and it made me sick,1,0

3802,i really really wanted to like julian po i think that slater is underrated as an actor and that many of the supporting players here are better than they are given a chance to demonstrate in this film i realize this is based on a short story which i have not read so i do not know if what i see as the films faults originated with the story or were imposed on it by the directorscreenwriter the premise is wonderful and i loved the voiceover confessional tone the opening narration strikes but then nothing several of the cliched local characters ask julian pointblank to explain his intention to commit suicide one could argue that he doesnt answer because its none of their business but julian is the one who under only token pressure blurted out his intentions in public then neither julian nor the directorwriter despite the fact that the julian character is keeping a tape recorded journal for gods sake seem inclined to provide anything beyond the scant initial information on julians life he says he was a bookkeeper he says his family moved around when he was a child due to his fathers job so what there are several interactions with the locals which seem designed to illuminate julians purpose but none of them go anywhere because julian seems to regard all these dopey locals as if they were aliens from another planet as if he were the ultimate and only sane one among them this might work as an allegory if julian po had any defining characteristics or anything approaching wisdom to impart the closest he comes to revealing anything about himself is in the scene in which he purposely humiliates the naive religious wife of the mechanic and what this scene reveals is not anything that would inspire empathy for julian i can only see the julian character as renderedas selfish petty and totally condescending sort of matches the attitude of the director of this halfbaked contrived film and poor michael parks an actor who once had so much promise is given nothing to work with here,1,0
3805,i dont see how anyone who even likes van damne could like this moviethe movie actually starts out with some promise i would say the action scenes at the beginning of the movie is excellent the actions scenes with the family ward trying to save the twins is a great start and is good lead in to the main story however the film is all down hill from there it would have been nice if the director could have stayed with the original premise that is the brothers are born in different parts of the world and thus learn different skills one brother is supposed to be skilled in martial arts but the other brother is supposed to be skilled in firearms how convenient when the time arises that the brother who has never picked up a gun before all of the sudden is a great marksman and the brother who has not been taught any martial arts is all of the sudden doing the splits and high kicksthe plot action etc are just plain ridiculous my favorite scenes how about when van damne is confronting an armed soldier with an ak47 the soldier is about 100 yards away instead of aiming and shooting at van damne he is doing a war cry like he is wielding a battle axe and running at him van damne proceeds to pick up a pistol from a fallen soldier and shoots himwhile he is still about 75 to 80 yards away this movie has one of the most disappointing endings bolo yeung is a skilled martial artist however instead of choreographing a decent fight bolo is throwing barrels at van damne like donkey kong absolutely aggravating movie that had so much promise if your a van damne fan save your time and see hard target or one of his earlier films,1,0

3847,when i bought 4 dvds for 5oo in a local shop it should have been warning enough that this movie was not up to the usual standard of david selznick productions with a cast containing such names as james stewart and carole lombard i was looking forward to a real treat as many other commentators have said it is an odd mixture of plot and scenes that doesnt quite convince however i am so glad that i did view this film as i now have the memorable saying never let the seeds stop you from enjoying the watermelon to live by this should sum up everyones life pick out those seeds or spit them out or swallow them and then enjoy the watermelon life itself,1,0
3856,so you might be reading some of the comments posted on this film and you might be thinking to yourself huh there were sure a bunch of rave reviews posted on december 30 funny thing is most of these rave reviews sound like theyre coming from the same person or at best a small coordinated group of open house groupies the truth my friends is that this film is truly unwatchable just because its independent doesnt mean it gets a free pass if youre going to make a musical whether on film or on stage whether on broadway or at the local community playhouse you should probably make sure that a your actors can sing b your actors can dance c you have decent sound equipment d you have a wellwritten score and e you have lyrics that are witty and charming even anthony rapp cant save this one its one of those unfortunate moviegoing experiences where i actually felt deeply embarrassed for everyone involved,1,0
3866,it starts really interesting the story develops around the main character who runs a cleaning business specialized in cleaning up crime scenes as a former cop he runs into some strange situation when one job does suddenly offically vanish furthermore he discovers some relation to an investigation into police corruption his columbo feeling is justified the deeper he gets into the background of the story the good actors jackson ed harris eva mendes play in an suspenseful story with some twists but only up to the last 25 minutes up to here 7 of 10 stars spoiler suddenly the movie looses its touch and in the end there is a completely unnecessary shootout involving the 14year old daughter a betrayal of friendship and a not justified righteousness out of the character development why not having cutler giving up his investigation for the sake of the friendship or having the daughter discovering some facts or many possible much better story finishes are imaginable a truly wasted ending,1,0

3990,ok this movie was really unique shall we say carrie fisher was by far the most talented in the movie even though it is said she had a coke problem during the movie but she said that she cant remember to much of it well thats her excuse but whats everyone elses i cant imagine they all had a coke problemwhatever it wasnt all that bad i mean i guess the plot was ok and it had some pretty funny moments although the part where the guy gets that thing shoved in his head was a little too violent for my taste oh well i guess i was disappointed cause carrie fisher is like so awesome and this movie did nothing for her,1,0
3998,had she not been married to the producer jennifer jones would not have been the most obvious choice for the leading female role in this tragic tale of an affair between an american soldier and an english nurse set against the backdrop of the first world war her british accent is not perfect and in the fifties it was unusual for a big romantic lead to go to an actress in her late thirties even one as attractive as miss jones especially when she was several years older than her leading man there were a number of beautiful young british actresses in hollywood around this time such as audrey hepburn elizabeth taylor jean simmons and joan collins any of whom might have been more convincing in the role but miss jones had one important attribute they all lacked namely a marriage certificate with david o selznicks name on it in the event the film turned out to be such a turkey that they were doubtless grateful not to have it on their cvs the film tells at great length the story of the romance between frederick an american volunteer serving with the italian army as an ambulance driver and catherine a nurse with the british red cross after the italian defeat at the battle of caporetto frederick is wrongly accused of being a german spy and sentenced to death the film paints a very harsh picture of italian military justice it would appear that italian courtsmartial had the power to pass the death sentence after a trial lasting all of thirty seconds without hearing any evidence and without allowing the defendant to be legally represented or to speak in his defence frederick manages to escape and to cross the border into neutral switzerland accompanied by the pregnant catherine hemingways novels have not always been a great success when filmed howard hawks succeeded in making a good version of to have and have not a film that is considerably better than the book on which it is nominally based but that is because he largely ignored hemingways plot and turned the film into a remake of casablanca set in martinique rather than french morocco like the 1943 version of for whom the bell tolls a farewell to arms is overlong and fatally slow moving it is also miscast jennifer jones never makes catherine come to life as for rock hudson his assumed christian name could be unfortunately appropriate he could be as solid as a rock but also as impassive as one and in this film his frederick seems an impersonation of the great stone face despite the passion and emotion inherent in hemingways plot the emotional temperature is always far too cool the picture has little going for it apart from some attractive picturepostcard views of italian and swiss scenery it is hardly surprising that it was not a success and that its failure ended selznicks career as a producer 410a goof shortly before the battle of caporetto an italian officer states that russia had already concluded a separate peace with germany that battle started in october 1917 at a time when kerenskys russia was still fighting alongside the allies the russian revolution did not take place until november it was only the october revolution by the old julian calendar the new bolshevik regime signed an armistice with germany in december 1917 but a separate peace was not signed until the treaty of brestlitovsk in march 1918,1,0
4001,but at least this movie got what it deserved to be sent to the satellite of love to be ridiculed on by mike tom servo and crow t robot from pearl forrester on mystery science theater 3000 soultaker is one of those long lost forgotten movies that are so bad youll be guaranteed to have nightmares or depression later on in life even though the movie is not that old its still a very forgotten type of movie if it had never been for the intelligent minds at mystery science theater 3000 the movie would not only seem like it was never made but the movie wouldnt be very enjoyable by us moviegoersin real life this movie is really bad in the satellite of love this movie is excellent,1,0
4012,i love how everyone treats this show like it was the next great american sitcom i watched five episodes of this abomination and the only person that came close to an actual teacher was the old guy that sort of loved and hated his job the rest of them were just pretty people trying to read the lines written by people who never actually went inside of a real classroom i loved how every episode consisted of the two idiots one who got laid and the other who didnt getting into some form of zany trouble that indirectly involved their students the british girl who thought she found an likable quality in the main idiot but in the end was somehow shocked that he turned out to be a jackass the hot chick that was there for the particular purpose of being hot and the principal and her lackey that served to somehow move the almost nonexistent plot forward i loved how almost all the teachers on this show were very young but i ask you to think back to your high school days and remember the teachers that you had did they look like that or did you go to the high school that had middleaged people teaching in it that is the high school that everyone else went to the show lacked any form of research into what goes on in schools in public schools principals do not have the power to higher and fire teachers the school board does but in every episode that i watched the principal made threats to fire her teachers think back to your history class or think of any history class did you ever see an incredibly hot british chick teach an american history class no did you ever see a teachers lounge that is so huge that you could actually play basketball in noteachers could have been a great show had it actually of based itself in some form of reality what makes teaching funny is the stories that you get from interaction with students and the teachers find it funny because they deal with the students day in and day out the overemphasis on their lives outside of teaching just made it another four camera sitcom that had unrealistic people in an unrealistic environment saying unrealistic lines and im sorry i just didnt buy it the show could have modeled itself after other currently successful sitcoms and used a singlecamera format and it should have centered more around the teachers relationships with their students and not with each otherit gets a star for trying and a star for the hot chick she was really hotin the end it was a failed sitcom that will go down in history as a hacks attempt to understand a profession i only hope that if they make another sitcom based on teaching that they learn from their mistakes so that a monstrosity such as this never touches the television screen,1,0
4087,the film shows relations of the dying mother and the son who is very attached to her and definitely loves her what does it show it shows their living in very poor conditions it shows how tenderly they walk really he is bringing her but what do we see further after their promenade he walks alone at the same places where they walked together it is not possible a person who love and care about another dying one would do everything to make the life of this one better he would not have a free minute to ponder to be alone with oneself and if he finds a few minutes a month for that he would run away from the places where he has usually to be another thing the author devoted this film to andrey tarkovsky we see he learned many tarkovskys visual effects but in sokurovs film they are only effects they do not support any senses or mood someone has compared this film with mirror zerkalo there is nothing common except these visual effects mirror is a great film and this one is just poor imitation,1,0
4091,its the best film that takes the first place at the sickest and an useful films ever made in this poor country really u people even dont know what the word cinema means and u cast votes for movies im really curious to know how many movies of ppp or lbunuel have u seen the score of this faield experiment it reflects a lot of ure way of understanding things and to recognize a goodquality movie when u see it we the romanian people have only one movie and until this day the status hasnt change that movie is padurea spanzuratilor but i dont lose my time thinking how many of you have seen it that is a movie that respects all the required qualityss of an movie from the script to the frames and even to the qualityclarity of the picture even are past over him 41 years i recommend to the voters to search for better movies and then vote kudos will see u later,1,0
4101,i was very willing to give rendition the benefit of the doubt when it came to all the negative press i had read concerning it even about threequarters of the way through i still thought it was jumbled and a bit incoherent but otherwise a solid tale reaching its conclusion and then the bottom fell out not wanting to necessarily ruin the film for anyone but the conclusion flips everything you held to be fact about what and when things have been happening on its headfor no particular reason whatsoever except to maybe tell the world yeah im cool and i know it i love a good twist i love a good ahha moment but only when it is relevant to the story at hand the complete misguidance on the part of the filmmakers serves no purpose on the overall tale timelines didnt need to be parallel and they didnt need to be separated by a week all the revelation did was destroy any merit i was about to give director gavin hood and screenwriter kelley sane which may be a good thing because looking back it wasnt really as solid a movie as i initially was going to blindly give it credit forit is an admirable thing to try and get the term rendition out into the filmgoing publics consciousness but it needed a story that delved deeper into the connotations and politics involved rather than gloss over those issues for a tale of a woman in distress over her husbands disappearance and the angstfilled rebellion of a daughter against her interrogator father i understand that the bottomline film attendee needs a human quality to grasp onto and for that reason i dont fault it for going that route my only qualm is that we dont get enough of what the title says we should be getting instead we are shown numerous plot lines all confusingly brought to the forefront before being sent back into the nether regions of our consciousness never to be returned to so much is going on that you forget what you are supposed to be caring for the wife the interrogator the cia agent the victim the senator the middle eastern daughter and her zealot boyfriend at the end i really just gave up and let the film take me where it would which ended up being someone totally different than what it first laid outeverything that occurs happens as the result of a bomb explosion this bomb is at the center of every story thread and finally ends up being so innocuous that you cant believe how huge the waves it spread were the old butterfly wings flapping quote is in full effect because one boys mission for revenge ends up destroying the lives of so many whether by death destruction physical and emotional abuse or career suicide no one really escapes unscathed however at the end of the day only the story about the man who has been excised to egypt for torture is really interesting we are led to believe he is unequivocally innocent from the start yet he is waterboarded electrocuted etc in order to extract any information he might have when those in power include a man with no compassion or reason to stop until something is spilled whether true or not and an observer without the guts to partake or stop it the situation lends itself some intrigue as to how it could possibly end the three actors involved all are the best parts of the film and prove once more that the movie should have concerned itself with them for the entiretyi dont want to belittle people like reese witherspoon the victims wife or her senate employed ex played by peter sarsgaard because they actual do a good job with what they are given even meryl streep her kooky accent and alan arkin dont detract too much however it is the trio of jake gyllenhaals cia agent yigal naors interrogator and omar metwallys victim that truly shine naor is brilliant as the egyptian trying to stay sharp as a razor during working hours yet compassionate and worryfilled as a father attempting to locate his daughter this man is brutal but he is because that is what his occupation calls for and why he is relied upon to find answers metwally never gives a false second during the pain and suffering inflicted upon him whether he is lying or truly knows nothing about the terrorist who has been calling his cell phone we totally buy into his plight and desperately wait to see how the situation turns out as for gyllenhaal someone who seems to have one performance recycled throughout his career with varying degrees of success he finds a part that suits him the demons entering his soul throughout the ordeal he is forced to be a part of wear on his body and mind causing both ambivalence and a need to intervene the two feelings wrestle with each other until he makes a final decision and his stoic boyish demeanor suit that battle perfectlyit is just too bad that the one plot line working never finds itself as the main focal point despite being the namesake of the film with all the clutter around the edges we as an audience get bounced around too much lulled into a sense of time and sequence and then slapped in the face as it all unravels in more of a laugh on us then a bet you didnt see that coming i felt cheated and unfortunately that is the lasting effect i have taken from the movie had it been more straightforward i might have enjoyed myself more but as is one can still take some positives from the severely flawed whole,1,0
4104,freeway killer is a madman who shoots people on the freeway while yelling a bunch of mystical chant on a car phone the police believe he is a random killer but sunny the blond heroine played by darlanne fluegel detects a pattern so does the excop played by james russo and they join forces and bodies in the search for the villain who has done away with their spouses also starring richard belzer this movie has its moments especially if you like car chases but its really not a good movie for the most part check it out if youre really bored and have already seen the hitcher joy ride or breakdown otherwise stay away from the freeway,1,0
4109,my age 13keats played by damon wayans and archie moses played by adam sandler are the best of friends and have been for a year what moses doesnt know is that keats is really jack carter an undercover cop who is waiting for the right time to bust moses and frank colton a major criminal who moses is involved with when colton and moses find out that keats is a cop colton wants to kill moses but he gets away after shooting carter in the head which does not kill carter moses is found by the cops and is taken for proof of coltons wrongdoing but when the cops including carter are about to escort him across the country on a plane all the other cops are killed and moses and carter are alone in the desert carter has to stay alive as well as take moses ina fairly average actioncomedy bulletproof has a fair plot but a lot of the film is just plain stupid for a comedy i found most of the jokes entirely unfunny but as an action movie it has a few fairly good action scenes not being a good fan of either adam sandler or damon wayans i found the acting and therefore the characters well below par the climax isnt really great and the film is so unrealistic it is not entirely bad but also not too good and it is far too short running below 85 minutes i though there was another 15 minutes left before it ended but there wasnt and the film felt too short overall not a complete waste of time but i still wouldnt recommend bulletproofaustralian classification ma 15 medium level violence sexual references medium level coarse languagerating 56 out of 100,1,0
4132,i think that you can not imagine how these people really work before i came to the studios to watch the guys work there i actually thought quite the same as you do but since i saw and did the work the guys on that tvshow have to do i have to say that they really do deserve respect for what they are doing all day long that really is no easy work and also the actors which in your eyes may be terribly bad are really great people and a lot of them really can act i dont think that the material given to them can really show that as i think this material isnt very good but they are truly good so i dont think that you before you havent seen these guys doing there work can judge over them and i shouldnt have judged over them as well before i met them but i did and am now terribly ashamed of it so please do not allow yourself to judge over these great people unless you havent seen them doing there job,1,0
4148,this miniseries is actually more entertaining than some others with much bigger budgets and grander aspirations sotd falls somewhere between kungfu and h r pufnstuff on the entertainment spectrum if it werent so long nearly 3 hours i think that kids would like it quite a bit its got adventure action cliffhanger scenes and not too much romance or other icky stuff when youre young youre not too critical of flexing rubber swords campy acting and scenes that are repeated at least two scenes are repeated identically in the movie just as was done in oldtime serials in order to bring the audience up to speed finally kids are usually more accepting of american english dialogue coming out of the mouths of asian actors not to mention the fact that several of the leading roles are played by nonasian actors i was going to give this movie three stars but i felt like the director producers and cast deserved some extra credit for at least carrying through on the project this movie is not art but like painting your house it actually took some time effort and discipline to get it madeoverall not a recommended use for your time but it might keep the kids entertained while traveling in the minivanoh yeahhey imdb dialogue is the preferred and traditional spelling your spellchecking seems to think that dialog is the proper spelling while dialog is acceptable both websters and the oed consider it an alternative form,1,0
4155,the film my name is modesty is based around an episode that takes up about one page in the 10th modesty blaise novel called night of the morningstar it describes an incident in which the young modesty 17 in the book mid twenties in the filmasserts her leadership in a war over a casino as this is set before the actual blaise adventures her trusted sidekick willi garvin is not in the film that is one of the main problems as the relationship between blaise and garvin was certainly always one of the fascinating aspects of the novels and the long running comic strip the other problem is that the film is quite simply incredibly boring because it really is just one small episode blown up into a screenplay the casting is okay but alexandra staden is not really convincing as the heroine and actually too old for the role to play the young modesty i get the impression that this film was a quick and dirty solution as not to lose the rights to the blaise franchise,1,0
4158,i went to see quitting with high hopes because the directors shower had impressed me so despite a few lapses into mawkishness shower ranks high on my list of alltime favorite movies for its penetrating insight into family relationships and its generally superb acting and direction and ive seen it at least three times nowbut quitting fell flat in my estimation it seemed a pointless exercise and i was quickly so tired of the main characters insufferable personality that i was longing for the movie to end i admit to falling asleep six or seven times but it was only for a few seconds at a time so i think its still ok to write this commenti did admire the parents and sister the device of using all real characters in the film is a nice one ive never seen used beforedisappointment aside i will still make an effort to see any film bearing yang zhangs name simply on the basis of the beautiful shower,1,0
4179,despite the fact that he worked for the worst government of the 20th century erwin rommel is generally wellregarded by historians and world war ii buffs as a gentleman a soldiers soldier and a brilliant tactician in the field of mechanized warfare if only hitler had given him the troops and materiel he had desired in africa the argument goes things would have gone very differently and thats probably true rommel was in fact a military genius and by all accounts an upstanding honest manbut this film goes out of its way to portray him as a nearsaint he does his job trying to win the war for hitler but constantly the fuhrer interferes and gives him ridiculous orders which rommel james mason expresses amazement with but rarely actually questions and never ever disobeys only when its patently obvious that hitler is leading germany to ruin does rommel think of treason against him this dilemma plays out as the main theme of the film a good man in bad circumstances trying to do the right thingmason is fine as rommel but its hardly a memorable performance along the lines of say george c scott as patton of course rommel wasnt as colorful as patton but this film is so intent on making him look like a decent human being that it forgets to make him interesting he occasionally lapses into some warmth when with his wife lucie a young jessica tandy wellcast but usually mason is called upon to give a stiff british performance as if the brits were trying to claim rommel for themselves though in all fairness all the nazis have english accents except hitlerdone on the cheap with any battle scenes swiping stock footage and the beaches of southern california doubling for tunisia theres nothing to particularly recommend this film a remake could be interesting id pick ed harris only because of a slight physical resemblance and well harris can act were it spiced up a little but this movie mostly demonstrated to me how much more demanding we as viewers have become in the last fifty years a biography this bland would never cut it any more,1,0
4186,to this day malcolm mclaren is telling anyone daft enough to believe him that the sex pistols were his idea and that the band members were his puppets to be used to make him money there is a good reason for him doing this namely that he is a liarhere are some real facts mclaren was actually approached by the band to be manager not the other way round the pistols were a proper organic band and not created by mclaren or anyone else jones and cook were childhood friends rotten and vicious went back a long way too this is something that has led to unfair criticism of the pistols down the years as they have been likened to manufactured boy bands the band and no one else wrote the songs recorded them played live created the publicity and gave the interviews mclaren did not instigate the bill grundy incident the pistols only appeared on the programme because queen had pulled out according to the band mclaren was cowering in the back in case arrests were about to be made johnny rotten walked out of the band he was not sacked far from outwitting the sex pistols john lydon rotten actually successfully sued him in the 1980s for control and a considerable sum of money some of the evidence used by lydons lawyers was from mclarens boasting in the great rock roll swindle this would suggest that mclaren is none too bright despite his affectations the sackings and subsequent pay offs from a m and emi were again not engineered it was merely the way things panned out mclaren boasts about the money he made from the band if he had been competent he could have made a great deal more it seems he coudnt even organise gigs properly mclarens claim at the start of the film that he invented punk rock can be disproved in about ten seconds the pistols were not the first punk band merely the most high profilethis is a terrible film the only parts worth watching are the genuine footage of the band later put to much better use in the filth and the fury,1,0
4225,a note to all of you budding film writers study this film if your dialog reads like the dialog in this film please shred your script and try againi didnt have high expectations but was intrigued by the description indicating there was a mystery at the christmas ornament factory the mystery is resolved very early and the film becomes a straight romance i almost stopped watching it at 5 minutes 10 minutes and at the first break my spouse who is the hallmark lifetime fan gave up at the first break forest river is a company town the main business is aikens ornaments who make all manner of holiday decorationsthe patriarch of the company has recently passed away so the companies future might be in question we soon meet noelle who would rather be on wall street than main street and the mysterious justin who gets a date with noelle after a large snowman she is inflating crashes into justins car once we meet alison aikens doing due diligence for the board we have our story setupif you cant nail all the story arcs by the first commercial break you havent seen enough of this kind of holiday film maybe thats a good thing,1,0
4255,in 1932 humphrey bogart was a relative unknownan unproven actor who was starring in one of his first films and because he was an unknown the movie they gave him was clearly a bmoviea quick film with relatively low expectations after seeing it i could see why it would still take bogart many more years and another film studio before he became a household name while the film isnt terrible it certainly isnt goodmaking it more of a curiosity than anything else when seen todaybogart is a pilot who has dreams of building his own aircraft engine company however when a vacuous rich playgirl comes his way his dreams all seem to go on hold as one of the characters in the film said the combination of the two is like oil and waterthey just dont mixwhile bogart is throwing away his promising career his sister is going full speed on the road to skankvillehaving met a sleazy guy who convinces her to sleep with rich guys so they can shake them down for tons of cash bogey has no idea his sister isnt the actress she claims to be and doesnt realize later that the rich woman he loves leaves him for the same guy whose mistress isbogarts sister all this leads up to a finale that is reasonably enjoyable however what follows is one of the dumbest scenes i have watched in a very long time by now the rich lady is not going to marry the guy sleeping with bogeys sister whew but because shes now poor and no good for bogart shes about to fly away and kill herself bogey finds out chases the plane on foot jumps on the plane as its taking off and crawls up the fuselage to take control of the plane and save her this is so utterly silly and ridiculous i found myself laughing out loud up until then i might have scored it a 4 or 5this sunk the movie to a 3 how one reviewer gave this an 8 is beyond methe bottom line is that this was a talking and silly film on top of that its all wrong for bogart as the action hero at the end and the simpering lover are horrible matches for his persona that was so wonderfully created in the early 40s manly and solid better suits the manone of americas great actors but clearly out of his element hereby the way those who love precode films and their very adult sensibilities may want to see this one practically everyone in the film believes in and practices premarital sex and bogey curses in the filmthings you never would have seen after the toughened and more moralistic production code was adopted in 1934,1,0
4264,nacho libre 2006 directed by jared hess starring jack black ana de la reguera hctor jimnez darius rose mpaa rating pg13 for some rough action and crude humor including dialog say what you will about it i know some people who despise it to no end but i have always thought that napoleon dynamite was a funny movienot the brightest brick on the wall but a funny movie nonetheless jack black is also a very funny manirritating at times yes and massively overrated by adolescent audiences who practically worship him but funny there has rarely been a jack black comedy that i did not enjoy to some degree so i was very happy to hear that jared hess the writer and director of napoleon dynamite and jack black would be teaming up for a movie about a spanish friar who becomes a wrestler to save an orphanage my only reservation was that the plot seemed a little too thin unfortunately my one reservation turned out to be downfall of the entire movie this plot had it been done as a skit on some such show as saturday night live or possibly even mad tv would have worked flawlessly unfortunately the plot runs far too thin over the approximate one and a half hour runtime and this onejoke comedy falls flatnacho was raised in a mexican monastery and became a devout man of the lord feeling shunned by the entire monastery nacho black now the monasterys cook decides to follow his dreams to become a professional wrestler as the monasterys finances hit an alltime low nacho decides to join a wresting tournament so that he can win the prize money and provide good food for the monasterys orphanage this plot sounds so sweet and caring it seems like the perfect movie for jack black look what he did with school of rock after all well to my displeasure this plot is almost completely ruined by offensive and gross humor that just takes away from the heart of the movie it is again hollywoods way of showing that they feel that teen audiences will only understand fart jokes and stupid humor of course for all i know maybe that is the general thought of teenagers as many seemed to enjoy this movie watching an obese woman scurry like a mouse across the floor will certainly make people laugh but dont expect to get an award for putting it in your movie a sevenyearold could make up the same jokethe performances in nacho libre are actually good jack black proves once again that he is absolutely hilarious and that he can make even the most idiotic worthless lines in ever put on paper comical unfortunately this movie just wasnt enough for him it didnt give him anything to go on and the only reason any of his jokes worked was because of him i had never seen or heard of ana de la reguera before but now i can say that not only is she quite talented but she is also one of the most beautiful women to have ever graced my eyesight she just clicked in the role and it worked wonderfully well hctor jimnez who plays nachos bumbling partner esqueleto kept me laughing continuously he did a very nice job and it was very effective when partnered with that of jack blacks darius rose who plays an orphan named chancho didnt have many lines but what can i say i just enjoyed him he was adorable the rest of the cast did their job it is unfortunate that they were wasted on such a subpar movienacho libre just does not work its plot is stretched far too thin the heart of it all is soiled by moronic humor and sickening jokes that just dont work i very rarely laughed and if i did it was because of jack black or another member of the cast and that leads me to the bright side of nacho libre yes the cast this cast was just well for lack of a better word they were on they all clicked had excellent chemistry together and pumped as much life as possible into the flat script after jared hesss napoleon dynamite kept me thoroughly entertained for the entirety of the movie i was surprised to find myself so often bored with nacho libre something was lost here and i have yet to understand what it was all i know is that nacho libre is not a good movie and yet because of its cast it is completely worthless there is a small reason to watch if only to watch jack black work but if you are not a fan of jack black then avoid this movie like the plague i like black but i am done with this movie and with this reviewfinal thought yikes this is jared hesss surprisingly disappointing followup to his hysterical napoleon dynamiteoverall rating 410 c,1,0

4268,this is one of those family movies that i cant imagine having much appeal to anyone over about 9 a group of siblings discovers a sand fairy yes really conveniently located at the end of a notsosecret passage at the country home of their eccentric uncle to which theyve been evacuated from the london blitz and there you have it all in one sentence the story is about the role of magic in childhood and the danger of getting wishes fulfilled but neither of these issues is examined in a way that would be interesting to adults or instructive to children or vice versa the only reason i can think of for watching this is to see how starkly freddie highmores outstanding talent stands out from the rest of the mediocre performances,1,0

4368,this is one of the strangest things on tv it is set in a bizarrely underpopulated midlands superb called leatherbridge which seems to be the dullest place in the country it features a bar with no visible staff or customers a university with no students a police station with no criminals and a doctors surgery with more doctors than patients the story lines are dire every episode revolves round a bizarre medical issue acted out by a variety of brummie extras who can never actually act and for some reason the doctor always ends up round their house solving their problem pretty entertaining for its pure comedy value but i cannot believe that this thing actually masquerades as a serious drama bonkers,1,0

4373,this was hitchcocks third hollywood feature and it appears he was yet to settle into a pattern of consistency turning from faithful adaptation of classic novel in rebecca to espionage thriller in foreign correspondent and now this romantic comedy in the mould of the screwball pictures of the 1930shitchcocks formal method on the other hand had by now settled into something consistent so much so that he was unable or at least unwilling to deviate from it it was unwise then for him to step outside his usual genre and a romantic comedy was particularly inappropriate in rebecca it was actually great to see hitchcock constrained by his producer and the source text forced to turn his technique to heavy gothic drama but for mr and mrs smith there is a huge mismatch between form and content in other words hitchcock was no ernst lubitschfirst lets look at the romantic angle the best love scenes in hitchcock films were wild passionate and slightly dangerous the ever fallen in love with someone you shouldnt have situation and he was great at depicting that this is something that makes a much earlier film rich and strange one of the few hitchcock nonthrillers that really works hitch is not so good however when it comes to a more gentle and familiar love story a light tender touch is required and hitch doesnt have itsecondly take the comedy of course hitchcock films could be funny the lady vanishes is probably the best example but only when the jokes were sprinkled throughout the story the master of suspense simply isnt enough of a comedy director to create a film that has funny bones he cuts up scenes as he would in a thriller snappy opposing angles of people talking inserted closeups of hands and feet pointofview shots but doesnt allow for comic timing or focus on gags for example the business with carole lombards dress bursting at the seems is shown to us with a couple of closeups but these are timed more as if he were revealing some crucial plot point and have no comedic impact occasionally hitchcocks style does roughly coincide with the comedy for example the arrangement of characters in the scene at the club where robert montgomery tries to make it look as if he is with the attractive sophisticated woman at the next table but such moments are few and far betweeneven the cast of mr and mrs smith are not up to standard im not sure this was robert montgomerys strength lay and he is boring here this was of course exactly where queen of screwball carole lombards strength lay and yet while she is clearly acting well the scenes are simply not geared to capturing comedy performances even jack carson who could be hilarious when he was really allowed to let go before the camera fails to perk things up at all of course neither of these fine comedy actors is helped by the screenplay which isnt exactly bursting with laughs in the first place even if the basic story is a fairly good premisethe only fullon comedy hitchcock made after this was the trouble with harry and that sort of worked because it played upon his familiar suspensefulness however it was only when the story could exist independently of the humour when the basic framework was suspense as it is in the lady vanishes or family plot that hitchcock was capable of doing comedy well,1,0
4394,hood of the living dead is about a young scientist named rick who lives with his brother in the town of oklahoma where drug dealers and prostitutes fill the streets then one night ricks brother gets shot by a gang driving down the street who fought with him earlier desperate rick calls his scientist partner to bring over the latest formula theyve been working on that brings sick blood cells to health the formula hasnt been tested on a human or even a dead body but rick is determined to bring his brother back to life he gives the body a double dose of the formula but nothing happens so rick calls 911 and the body is carted away only for it to come back to life and feast on human flesh now rick must find his zombie brother before the whole hood is transformed into a neighborhood of the dead hood of the living dead is one piece of trash the plot is a direct rip off of resident evil the acting is just horrible especially with rick s fake crying for his brother the guns are so fake because every time the weapon is fired it sends sparks out and the make up is just lame its only fake blood covered over the actors face the zombies are also modified they run growl and must be shot in the heart to die zombies should only scuffle moan and must be shot in the brain to die this film is so horrible the outtakes is the only true good moment of this film hood of the living dead gets a 3 out of 10 a little entertainment here and there but it only succeeds as a low budget cringe fest,1,0

4417,frank capras creativity must have been just about spent by the time he made this film while it has a few charming moments and many wonderful performers capras outright recycling of not just the script but considerable footage from his first version of this story broadway bill 1934 is downright shoddy it is understandable that he would reuse footage from the climactic horse race which is thrilling but he uses entire dialogue scenes with minor actors then brings back those actors and apparently expects us not to notice for example that ward bond is 14 years older unless you want to see one of the last appearances of oliver hardy skip this one and watch broadway bill instead,1,0

4465,before launching into whether this film is worth your time or not i should inform you ive never seen another adaptation of carmen so if youre looking for a review on how it ranks amongst others this might not be of much use to youthe only time ive come across carmen was on the car stereo when driving through spain on a family holiday when i was a teenager i didnt pay much attention to it because i didnt like opera at the time and i didnt know any better the story has been around for 150 years or so do i feel ive missed out after seeing this movie yes mainly due to the plot but also because if all the actresses who played carmen looked like paz vega i would have all the adaptations happily sitting in my dvd collectiondirected by vicente aranda who also corewrote the story with joaquim jord the story is told through the eyes of the original author prosper mrime a french writer making his way through 19th century spain he comes across jos leonardo sbaraglia a delinquent soldier and one of many men who fall in love with carmen paz vega a sultry sexy bedazzling gypsy woman who has the mouth of the devil the temper of a toro and who recklessly leads men to their doom the moment she meets jos she is attracted by his standoffish behaviour but she hooks him reels him in and lets him go manyatime until one day jos is wanted for murder carmen persuades him to join her band of gypsy smugglers they seem to be settling shes fallen in love with him but she meets the charming escamillo the bullfighter can jos hold his jealousy in check or does it destroy him its a beautifulseductive story something that resembles almost a shakespearian or ovid plot with the portrayals of immense passion and emotion that can make or break us and transform us to do things out of character its poetic fiery and above all slutty i was left hanging on i didnt know which way it was going to turn i always hoped that jos might change carmens dirty little ways i wont tell you if he succeeded or notthe above synopsis is what i took away from the film but i was not impressed by the film itself it was only after i watched it that i dug a little deeper into the story and i realised how much of a missed opportunity aranda had made of retelling mrimes classic it was a shallow slutty perioddrama blunder that saw paz vega spend a lot of the time partially or completely naked not that im complaining about this in particularfirst of all the acting was poor i was not impressed by sbaraglia as jos im still unsure whether he was a weak actor or jos was supposed to be a weak character ive not read the book hes supposed to be a man who with burning desire for carmen but he spends much of the time looking confused jealous and a bit dim paz vega was slightly better as carmen i was convinced by her hardened wicked character although i have seen more convincing performances by her in other films such as zapping and lucia y el sexo she seems too pretty to play a gypsy woman not that ive come across many andalusian gypsy women so in a way the role didnt really fit her the other actors in the film werent great either they seemed to do everything halfheartedly the story is passionate emotive they looked halfarsed as if they couldnt wait to get out the tight 19th century costumes they were wearinghowever the costumes i was impressed with one of the redeeming factors of the film i like spanish culture i liked the soldiers uniforms the tophats and the womens flamenco dresses they fitted the time well thats all i can really say about that sorry back to the criticismthe script as stated above was corewritten by vicente aranda and joaquim jord and done so badly so much that it would leave mrime turning in his grave it was boring it didnt make best use of joss intense passion for carmen or maybe that was just the acting there were cheesy lines piled upon one and other satan and devil connotations everywhere amongst the millions of swear words i know the spanish are partial for the odd swear word but the film was littered with puta whore in literally every line maybe it was realistic in 19th century povertystricken seville but the story itself didnt need itthe editing and camera work was dull and ordinary there was only one bit i actually liked and that was when the camera follows a fly closeup in midair which lands on carmens face that was good but the rest boringto conclude it is sad to see such a great story go to waste with unconvincing acting and directing if youre a literature teacher by all means let your class watch this adaptation to get an idea of the story however only the male half of the class will be paying any interest to the film thanks to paz vega otherwise stick to the opera version even though i hate musicals i give this film 4 just for the fact i love the storyline and paz vega,1,0

4561,ordinary decent criminal is sort of based on the exploits of martin cahill already the subject of john boormans 1998 film the general cahill had a rough upbringing in a slum area and graduated from petty crime to armed robbery with honours he justified his criminal career by pointing out his poor background at every opportunity this is a common excuse for criminals that conveniently overlooks the thousands of slumdwellers who dont turn to robbing post offices and selling guns in order to make ends meet cahill made fools of the police and local authorities not to mention the ira which earned him a sort of folk hero status as well as making him many enemies however he was basically an amoral selfserving thiefmy primary problem with odc is that the protagonist is made out to be a lovable irish rogue kevin spacey does a good job portraying michael lynch with a blend of oily charm and quiet menace but the character is too amoral and selfish to be seen as any sort of hero even an antihero the film is well shot and well acted by a fine cast but what lets it down is the script writer gerard stembridge cant make up his mind is he writing an irish lock stock or a grittier treatment of martin cahills thieving career thats the problem when a writer bases his central character on a real person its also unfortunate that odc followed the cinema release of john boormans the general which was a more accurate portrayal of martin cahills story cahill was a cunning thief who knew the value of good publicity so its not surprising that his exploits got the movie treatmentwhat is surprising is that a studio was prepared to take cahills story and give it a happy hollywoodstyle ending kevin spaceys charismatictwinklybigamistthief michael lynch gets to ride off into anonymity on his motorcycle in odc in the real world martin cahill was executed by the ira just to prove that noone makes fools of an outdated sectarian and corrupt paramilitary organisation and gets away with it the real cahill would never have walked away from his notoriety because it bolstered his man of the people selfimage having michael lynch give up everything to avoid death in odc is a copout ending to a weak and shallow movie,1,0

4588,ill admit that this isnt a great film it practically screams lowbudget yet oddly i still found myself liking the film because although it lacked quality it abounded with energy it was like the little engine that could and a movie merged into one the film takes place at a radio network and concerns some of their lowlevel employeestwo page boys one very pushy and brash and the other one a wuss as well as a new receptionist all three have visions of radio stardom but must for now content themselves with their lowly jobsinto this story appears a murder that seems somewhat out of the blue i didnt know that this was a murder mystery film and was taken a bit by surprise however like most bmysteries the cops are lamebrains and its up to our pushy hero moran to try to save the day throughout all this i had a hard time deciding if moran was obnoxious or endearing im still not sure there is a moment in the film that is high on the cringe factor and that is when the two pages try out for the roles of radio comedians they show up in blackface and do a 3rd or 4th rate imitation of amos n andy apart from being very insensitive it also wasnt funny fortunately the producer of the show they were trying out for seemed to feel the same wayoverall its easy to skip this film and i wouldnt blame you if you do however the weird and frenetic pace of the film actually seemed to make up for the artistic deficiencies of the film and i am glad i saw it a good film no but one that is still worth a peek for fans of old bsby the way perhaps i just dont have very good taste but i thought both female singing divas really had poor voices despite how everyone in the film is captivated by their warblings listen for yourself and let me know what you think i just couldnt believe either was allowed to sing on filmeven if it was just for lowly monogram studios,1,0

4773,ok let me again admit that i havent seen any other merchant ivory the distributor films nor have i seen more celebrated works by the director so my capacity to discuss before the rains outside of analysis of the film itself is mitigated with that admittance let me beginbefore the rains is a different kind of movie that doesnt know which genre it wants to be at first it pretends to be a romance in most romances the protagonist falls in love with a supporting character is separated from the supporting character and is sometimes united with his or her partner this movies hero has already won the heart of his lover but cannot be with her his name is henry moores and her name is sajani and they reside in southern india during the waning days of the raj british imperial rule henry has been away from london for a long time and has fallen in love with his married indian maid despite his legal marriage and child overseas what could be better than that they often sneak away for intimate afternoons until some children notice them word spreads to sajanis husband who questions her involvement with moores she denies any contact with him but moores asks her to leave the area sajani refuses because of her devotion to him and commits suicide please take note that these events occur in the opening third of the film the film changes tone and becomes a crimedrama in its final portionssajanis body is discovered right as moores family comes to visit the alleged perpetrator is mooress englisheducated assistant tk tk knows of his masters affair but keeps silent until his life becomes threatened once he is declared innocent he attempts to regain his honor by killing moores tk is too squeamish and leaves him in a dirt path as the rains falli want to warn you this isnt a romance film the dvd cover and theatrical posters show an indian woman and caucasian man embracing in an idealized tropic setting this image is captured directly from the films opening but quickly disappears then its over it seems like an effort to capitalize on western fixation on forbidden love it isnt effective at all not only is the movie not a romance but its characters lack any personality they are bundles of walking clichs moores is an arrogant white man who doesnt recognize his indian friend tks intelligence tk is torn between his own heritage and his educative background sajani is a woman incapable of having a choice in her romantic life oh and of course moores family is inquisitive into sajanis death but still slightly racist to indians if the tone wasnt so serious i would be willing to overlook these problems but it isnt the film is presented with a didactic overtone which highlights its poor character developmentno this film isnt terrible other than the laughable screenplay it isnt poor the actors are all experienced and perform well here nandita das who plays sajani was part of wonderful indian drama water even director sivan has an impressive resume he recently oversaw the terrorist which is part of roger eberts great movies collection what happened here why is this movie so bad well sivan mentioned how he was inspired to direct this film because of a short he viewed in israel called red roofs apparently the story was timeless and sivan sought to create a similar experience set in 1930s india i dont have any problem with that approach but i think sivan may have been too motivated this time the actors cinematography and set design are acceptable but unless you share sivans aura youll probably not enjoy it my recommendation is that you presume you arent in accordance with him and watch something else final consensus and out of,1,0
4787,true story of three girls who go into the wilds of connecticut and end up hunted by a maniac in the woods this is the sort of film that would have played in the drive ins across america thirty years ago to mixed acclaim not particularly much of anything the film works with its low budget to mixed results the film is watchable but isnt at all scary blame how some of the attack scenes for that its the sort of film that youll probably forget about once youre done with it odds are that youre never going to think to see this unless its handed to you by someone and told here watch this which is what happened to me if youre handed a copy give it back the film isnt worth the effort to see it even if it is watchable,1,0
4822,i very much looked forward to this movie its a good family movie however if michael landon jrs editing team did a better job of editing the movie would be much better too many scenes out of context i do hope there is another movie from the series theyre all very good but if another one is made i beg them to take better care at editing this story was all over the place and didnt seem to have a center which is unfortunate because the other movies of the series were great i enjoy the story of willie and missy theyre both great role models plus the romantic side of the viewers always enjoy a good love story,1,0
4831,just watched on ubuweb this early experimental short film directed by william vance and orson welles yes you read that right orson welles years before he gained fame for radios the war of the worlds and his feature debut citizen kane welles was a 19yearold just finding his muse besides vance and welles another player here was one virginia nicholson who would become orsons first wife she plays a woman who keeps sitting on something that rocks back and forth courtesy of an africanamerican servant paul edgerton in blackface during this time a man welles keeps passing her by courtesy of the scene constantly repeating i wont reveal any more except to say how interesting the silent images were as they jumpcut constantly thats not to say this was any good but it was fascinating to watch even with the guitar score by larry morotta added in the 2005 print i watched worth a look for welles enthusiasts and anyone with a taste of the avantgarde,1,0
4839,i know this film was shown on local tv when i was a kid but i cant remember whether i watched it or not seeing it now considering how utterly forgettable it is i still dont know so i counted it as a first viewing there have been several films featuring the title character a creation of visionary french author jules verne these include 20000 leagues under the sea 1954 with james mason in the role master of the world 1961 vincent price mysterious island 1961 herbert lom captain nemo and the underwater city 1969 robert ryan and the mysterious island of captain nemo 1973 omar sharifthis version stars academy award winner jose ferrer however even if the premise itself isnt halfbad awakened from suspended animation in his submarine the nautilus and finding himself in modern times nemo adopts all his ingenuity to aid the us navy in defeating megalomaniac scientist burgess meredith it emerges as easily his most infantile adventure yet for instance five seconds into the film merediths assistant donning a steel mask rants that the world shall be ours equally hilarious are the zealous gesticulations of the similarly deckedout midget whose task it is to fire the professors allimportant delta beam and how about those androidtype minions aboard merediths vessel who never seem to do much of anything ferrer manages to maintain his dignity throughout but meredith is an embarrassment in what is virtually a retread of his penguin characterization from the 1960s batman tv series and film where the budget was so tight mostly invested in bland production design and shoddy special effects no doubt and both evidently influenced by star wars 1977 that apparently they couldnt even afford him a decent costume he looks positively idiotic wearing a tie in a sub the supporting cast includes mel ferrer playing a saboteur in the vein of joan fontaine from another irwin allen production voyage to the bottom of the sea 1961 and who engages in a swashbuckling routine with his namesake inside the engineroom of the nautilus lynda day george unsurprisingly shes the only female character around and horst buchholz as the king of atlantis for whatever reason nemo is obsessed with locating the famed lost continentby the way having been reduced from a threepart miniseries for theatrical exhibition the film obviously feels choppy though one is still able to discern where one episode ended and another began,1,0
4858,so many bad reviewers it made me wonder what people are thinking while watching a simple flick made by a quite bad director did you all expected a superhit flawless movie no way you already can see raj kumar kohli loves multistarrer movies all of his earlier works where multistarrers but no one was flawless take the first jaani dushman for instance so many flaws but still good fun anyways sticking to the movie the movie jaani dushman is a hindi fantasy film about a snake who can take any form armaan munish kohli which takes revenge for the suicide of its lover manisha koirala on the people who caused it its quite good with a great starcast but i think it could have been much much better for instance take the script cant say its flawless for example take the agesdo 4048 yrs old still study in universitythere are many many more i wont list more but there are dozen more a solid 55 is good for this one75,1,0

4864,the breadth height of the scale of this movie overwhelm me about a week ago i posted a commentary on the 1926 silent epic maciste in hell referring to it as staggering then i encountered the pollonia bros blood red planet wow its all about the scale of the thinking behind it the pollonia bros and colleague john mcbride were thinking so big that the musings of arthur c clark stanley kubricks 2001 a space odessey is lucky it was released thirtytwo years before this sweetheart as a matter of fact kubrick had it easy with modelers a budget actual actors and major studio backing for his little star trek ripoff and all that arthur c clarke had to do was write the damn thing whats so hard about muscling around a typewriter the pollonia brothers on the other hand had to think radical outside of the box and quickly they recruited a half dozen of their friends colleagues including a hot lookin chick bought a bunch of colored lightbulbs raided old office supply dumps for every keyboard monitor and handsfree phone headset they could find got everybody identical black turtlenecks made off with every cupcake tin in the county learned enough 3d modeling texture skinning to animate a couple of space ship flybys spent a couple hours drumming up a script executed what is easily the most frightening space monster puppet since that horrible little monster jabba the hut carried around with him was fried by r2d2 spent literally days working with a vhs camera and an amiga to shoot edit their film and came up winners this is the best diy direct to home video fan movie space epic ive ever seen and in proportion to the amount of talent resources at the disposal of the filmmakers dwarfs even logans run or battlestar galactica the original series as being a chilling look at our future right down to a newscaster wearing a mismatched illfitting 2nd hand suit as a species we are doomedseriously for a minute though it is a vast improvement upon such later epics as the dinosaur chronicals or preyalien alien predators which is funny since it was made before either of those masterpieces somewhere along the lines the pollonias started taking it easy on themselves this film is executed with a certain conviction that gets you to believe that you really can breathe in a vacuum wearing a dust mask and two biker squirt bottles and the scene where the alien beast consumes a miniaturized crew member made me immediately think of where id seen that before godzilla vs the sea monster where the giant rampaging monster crab skewers two canoers and eats them on camera that made me cry when i was a kidthis made me cry as an adult because here i am wasting my time trying to be some sort of critic or writer or writercritic and these guys get to have all the fun actually making a real feature length scifi epic with lots of cool colored lights a hot chick and a talking slide projector named kal one of the flight crew even gets to wear his black space baseball cap backwards glower with his goatee like that clown from metallica is this supposed to be a joke no it is an epic statement about humanity from humanity and for humanity that deserves to be seen by anybody who has the capability to not take any of it too seriously look for it on a 2 disc box set called galaxy of terror in your favorite discount retailers cutout dvd bins which is probably where it belongs but how many of us can say yeah they have a couple box sets of our movies for sale at best buy 410 anyone lacking in a sense of humor might want to try silent running or maybe tron but someday an alien civilization on the other side of the galaxy will intercept a transmission of this movie and decide that we actually are not to be messed with good work guys,1,0

4867,spoilers sorry the first word that sprung to mind whilst watching the film is gremlins its the only critters movie i have seen from the four movies but i enjoyed it it wasnt too complicated as i hadnt seen the past two but i thought it was quite a good movie all the same critters starts with a man his son and daughter stopping off on the way to a vacation although it turns out that they end up at their own home which i have no idea what the hell went on the girl meets up with a boy played by leo dicaprio and they go hang out in a nearby forest they meet this weird guy who tells them to be careful and stuff because of the critters he seems a bit psychotic and if i was in that situation i would not speak to him the critters steal a ride of the girl and boys car and end up in their flat thing they hide out in the basement and end up killing this lazy jerk they then nearly kill this fat woman and the girls dad they are chased higher and higher up the flat until they hide in the attic the critters eat stuff in the kitchen spoof of the gremlins kitchen scene and i cant remember not a good thing but im sure they have to go back for somethingsomeone anyway they end up getting out and saved the psychotic guy comes back and before he kills the last two critters he is told he cant because they are endangered and so he sends them homethe ending was disappointing and i was annoyed that only the lazy guy died as there were quite a few annoying characters i would personally have killed off its a thrilling exciting movie worth a watch but if youre looking for a better version of this genre i recommend the gremlins movies sorry,1,0
4870,sorry about that but if you have seen this epic you will obviously know of the utter disregard for the actual text of the bible now im not exactly the next in line for sainthood but i do know the basics and the basics were this god wanted to wipe everyone of the face of the earth because he believed they have been corrupted to the point of no return he chose noah the diamond in the rough and his family to be spared due to their uncorrupted ways noah builds an ark as instructed by god to house he his family and two of every creature while he floods the rest of the planet those are the basics in this movie you have other people roaming around the seas such as peddlers and pirates but i thought that everyone was wiped out i guess the executives at nbc have never been to church there are other inaccuracies im told but being the average joe i have no idea what they are sorry back to the movie it was inaccurate as stated before the acting stunk but some of the effects were good ill give it that but as a whole ive seen a better and more tasteful rendition of the story done as a little scene on the simpsons god help the nbc executives come judgement day 310,1,0

4881,i dont understand people why is it that this movie is getting an 83 i had high hopes for this movie but once i was about a half hour into it i just wanted to leave the theater in the vast majority of the reviews on this site people are saying that this is one of the best action movies theyve seen or of the summer year etc they say its an excellent conclusion wtf what has been concluded besides the fact that bourne can ride motorcycles shoot and fight better than anyone else he comes across what do you learn about bournes character in this movieabsolutely f nothing okay theres a lot of action but whats so great about the action in this movie i dont like the cinematography and film editing the shaky camera effect and fast changing shots were used too much and they get old fast i didnt mind them in supremacy because it was still easy to follow and was not used in excess and made me quite dizzy i was quickly wishing i had saved my for something elsethis movie has no plot all this movie is is a 115 minute chase seen bourne who you learn absolutely nothing about in the entire 115 minutes of the movie is a perfectionist at everything he attempts there is absolutely no character development in this movie you know nothing about anyone and there is a wide array of new characters that are introduced in this installment some people said that this movie has incredible writing and suspense what writing what suspense theres no suspense bourne is so perfect at doing everything he does i dont think he has anything to worry about if this is the best movie of the year 2007 i may just quit watching movies entirely many people have also said that matt damons performance in this movie is one of the best if not the best of his career what performance how many lines did he have in this movie i have some respect for damon because he has been in movies that i liked and has played different kinds of characters but a good actor is someone that you can barely recognize from one movie to the next someone who chooses different types of roles not someone who plays the same roles over and over again which damon doesnt do but an example of someone who does is vin dieselanyways this movie was a big disappointment to me i do not recommend this movie but i do recommend the first two bourne identity and bourne supremacy and i most definitely recommend reading the three books which are much different then the movies,1,0
4912,i love japanese movieshaving seen at least 100200 so its obvious i am not afraid of japanese films however sometimes there are japanese concepts for film that just dont translate well to westerners they might be hits at home but abroad they just dont seem wellnormal its like the live fish my wife ate on a business meeting or odd ps2 games such as dating simulators or katamari damacythings that are accepted there that confuse nonjapanese this is probably the way others view things americans take for granted such as american football fried snicker bars and paris hilton well the king of strange japanese films that just dont seem right to americans might just be atamayama now the style of animation isnt the issueits different but nice enough no its the story concept itself and the rather bizarre ending thats what make this a truly unusual film and it goes like this there was a stingy man who for no apparent reason had a tree growing out of his head it was little at first and he simply cut it away but again and again it grew backso he just decided to let it go and after a while people began living on his head under the shade of the tree oddly while they were under the tree they were tiny but when they left they were full sized again then after finally getting sick of it all and yanking out the tree the man drown himself in the hole in the top of the head where the tree was the endsee i told you this was very very oddbut not in a good way like tampopo or happiness of the katakurisjust odd oddodd and unless you have a very high tolerance for this sort of thing i doubt if youll feel bad to know that this oscarnominated film did not win frankly that makes me happy as i really dont want this film to spur on such similar films the only reason it earns a 4 is due to nice but not spectacular animationthis film made my brain hurti hope that isnt a sign that i have a tree,1,0

4951,there is an inherent problem with commenting or reviewing a film such as this i remember feeling the same way after disliking dogma if you do not like a film that is odd and controversial like mulholland dr you are seen as not getting it of course for those who have already seen this film you know that the entire point is not getting it anywayi have heard from several different sources that the unique and likable aspect of this film is a dreamlike quality it has in other words the plot isnt structured like other films with the case of mulholland dr it seems more like an unfocused collage made by a third grade boy who procrastinated until the last second to do his art project it doesnt make sense it isnt supposed to but i know it was to be a tv series at first it appears lynch had a stack of unused film and decided to mash it in with a bunch of new stuff you will notice that toward the end the nudity sex and foul language increase all things he would not have filmed for televisionfor a better film not told in a traditional linear fashion rent the thin red line from 1998 that was a great film this is notrating 2 out of ten,1,0
4952,the last station director michael hoffmans melodrama about the last months in the life of leo tolstoy begins with fog and sleep tolstoy christopher plummer lives with his family in a compound at yasnaya polyana taking walks and writing and being seen to by his wife and the adherents to his movement people dedicated to his ideas of pacifism vegetarianism sexual abstinence and communal property who have gathered in a forest camp not far away his wife sophia helen mirren wars openly with the head of his movement chertkov paul giamatti who she claims in his efforts to convince tolstoy to sign the rights to his works over to the russian people is trying to steal the wealth that is owed to her upon her husbands imminent death observing all of this is tolstoys new steward bulgakov james mcavoy a naive adherent who is torn between his love of the man and concern for his wifehoffmans script which is based on the novel by jay parini quite often veers itself into confused territory building up a complex tangle of threads and opaque motivations that ultimately dont resolve themselves in any satisfying way the scope of the film is grand and its story should reverberate just as tolstoy whose beliefs foreshadowed in some ways both the bolsheviks and those of pacifists like ghandi it unfortunately doesnt its ununpickable building up with much gusto confrontations that are constantly ravelling off into nothingness the threeway relationship between the church the faithful sophia and the unbelieving tolstoy for example is referenced often in the last section of the film a mute priest in a magnificent hat even shows up but the script never expands on this beyond awkwardly inserting it into the story as an attempt at enriching it or providing some semblance of historical accuracy there are a ton of details in the film but not enough attention is paid to most of them and as a result the film feels cluttered overburdened energetic but unfortunately pointlessat its heart is the love story between sophia and tolstoy and that story as baffling and cramped as it is is the reason to watch the film mirren and plummer are unsurprisingly the best things in the film plummers tolstoy is vague at once confused and resolute apprehensive and full of joy and certainty mirrens sophia is in full panic in a righteous lather forced to watch and expected to be mute as her husband gives away his time his possessions and his money to people who are unquestionably devoted to him but also clearly in possession of their own agendas theyre great performances all the more so given the vast gulf between the real importance of the couples place in history and the scripts ability to support that both sophia and tolstoy seem willed into the film by mirren and plummer alone both making the best they can out of what meagre material is there giammati and mcavoy both talented actors are unable to do the same and giamattis chertkov seems neither a revolutionary nor a thief and not both at once either but rather a cipher a standin for a whole package of unresolved anxieties and aborted historical impulses the scope of this thing never boils down to anything it hitches along getting by on the strength of plummer and mirren and not much else its interesting and pretty but ultimately unrewarding 4510,1,0
