9,if theres one genre that ive never been a fan of its the biopic always misleading filled with false information overdramatized scenes and trickery all around biopics are almost never done right even in the hands of the truly talented directors like martin scorsese the aviator and ron howard a beautiful mind they often do a great disservice to the people they are trying to capture on screen skeptiscism takes the place of hype with the majority of biopics that make their way to the big screen and the notorious bettie page was no different some critics and moviegoers objected to gretchen mol given the role of bettie page saying she was no longer a celebrity and didnt have the chops for the part i never doubted mol could handle the part since but i never expected to as blown as away by her performance as i was upon just viewing the film hours ago mol delivers a knockout oscar worthy performance as the iconic 1950s pinup girl who after an early life of abuse depicted subtlety and tastefully done something few directors would probably do inadvertently becomes one of the most talked about models of all time the picture covers a lot of ground in its 90 minute running time yet despite no less than three subplots there is still a feeling that there may be a small portion missing from the story directorcowriter marry harron and guinevere turners fantastic script is only marred by a too abrupt and not as clear as it should be ending still credit must be given to the two ladies for creating a nearly flawless biopic that manages to pay tribute to both its subject and the decade it emulates masterfully come oscar time mol turner and harron should be receiving nominations doubt it will happen though there certainly are no three women more deserving of them 910,0,1
19,especially after watching the matrix reloaded spoilersafter seeing the matrix with all its ridiculous fantasy makebelieverobotic characters with their super powers it was refreshing to see an action movie with real people in situations that involved actual risk i cared about these people and even though some of the stunts seemed a bit much it still left me feeling like its possible verses what a stupid video game like the matrixthis movie isnt brain surgery its very straight forward some things are predictable like knowing that someone is going to be a backstabber and that someone early on is going to die pretty obvious but so what the first 15 minutes sets up our reason our motive our main objectivei like that theron and walhberg didnt have any makeout scenes i am glad that they didnt go there they kept it about funny dialogue especially seth greene that guy is funnythis is a movie that i would buy when it comes out on dvd its fun fast and entertaining the only thing and i guess its a big thing is that we are really rooting for the bad guys this group of protaganists are already on the wrong side of the law not a good message for the kiddies parents please explain this to them,0,1
25,i attended camp chesapeake it was located at the head of the chesapeake bay on the north east river in md it was a similar type summer camp with cabins it was established by the coatesville pa ymca i started out as a young camper and later became a junior senior counselor and later the waterfront director if the camp had continued i would have done anything within my power to become the camp director alas the powers of the ymca decided to close down the camp and sell it to the state of md i visited the former camp some years later by boat and was dismayed by the neglect of the state of md and natural destruction by mother nature the 350 acre site served so many with all the benefits of contact with natures offerings a black man by the name of curtis ford and his family were residents and caretakers of the property mr curtis was my friend and mentor i idolized his every being even as he could not swim he was a waterman if i asked him where the fish were biting he would designate the spot and i would have a ball ther was also a family camp at the end of the summer these memories will be with me for eternity,0,1
36,if youve ever wondered why they dont make porn with a plot watch dream quest on the one hand you have to give the armstrong credit both for making the effort to capitalize on this idea and for using such a strong adult cast to put some name power behind it on the other hand it also quickly becomes apparent why most porns never have more than 15 or 20 seconds of dialog connecting sex scenes together these people simply cannot act and the story is unfortunately lame to a ridiculous degreestill i gave it a 7 because it was a nice try and there didnt seem to be much of an effort to cut corners also id like to see more attempts like this one maybe someday i will see the perfect combination of porn and plot,0,1
70,now i know french inmates are unlikely to have read lovecraft and that proves my point that his writings should be taught in school maybe as a separate subject but how did they think something that sounds like ftagn yog sototh could possibly lead to any goodthe movie takes place in a prison where four very unlikely cell mates stumble upon a magical book that may if read right get them out as prisons go the cell was totally unrealistic so that made it hard for me to get into the atmosphere of things it also moves rather slowly which may bore people but other than that this is top notch horror feeling mixing sartres hell is other people with a lovecraftbarker type of story and doing rather successfullybottom line take the time to watch this that means not doing it when you are about to go to work or to sleep or while doing something else this is a movie that works best if you are immersed into it lessons to be learned yog is bad almost as bad as french women,0,1
93,i like cheap perfume better it doesnt last as long ralph meekers convict character lawson tells this to barbara stanwycks helen character after he gets a whiff of the perfume that she picked out wher husband in tijuana this line cracked me up and also seemed like a metaphor for this film that cheap is better than expensive because a cheap perfumeloving man who has a way with a 2 x 4 is a better man to have around in the long run i agree with some of the other comments posted about helens attraction to lawson even though her narration states that she wants lawson to be put away she did seem attracted to his fiery nature and that passion he stirred up in her wouldnt likely wash away with the tide,0,1
99,after all the crap that hollywood and the indies have churned out we finally get a movie that delivers some scary moments there are some clichd moments but im not sure its possible nowadays to make an entirely original movie theres not much new hereits just done wellmake sure and pay attention as the subtle scares come quickly and often this is not a movie to watch while youre eating pizzatheres one very wellwritten red herring in this movie and unfortunately one very poorlycast role cheri christian just doesnt make an effective julie the wifemother for one thing shes totally unsympathetic i know i knowshes just gone through a traumatic experience but the viewer never gets to know her as she normally is and the relationship between her and her husband is rather discomforting in an unintentional way i think that the director had meant for us to have some sympathy for her but i never didfinally a thumbsup for the ending which is both disturbing and satisfying it could easily have been cheapened with a sound effect at the beginning of the end credits but the director wisely resistedthis is not a masterpiece by any means but it is a good oldfashioned scary moviesomething thats rather rare nowadays,0,1

119,while i am not a big fan of musicals i have loved the films of fred astaire and ginger rogers because they are just so much fun sure they can be a bit formulaic but even though you know what is going to happen they still are very pleasing to watch however despite this i was a bit disappointed in this outing part of it was because this film doesnt have the wonderful supporting cast like you saw in top hat or shall we dance without edward everett horton or eric blore the film seems to be a bit lackingespecially in the fun department the silly antics of these supporting actors gave the other films charm that you just dont get with follow the fleet in addition unlike the usual character played by astaire this one is more of a jerkas his fat head gets rogers into trouble again and again and as a result its a lot harder to like him or want to see them get together in the end of the film plus although the music is by irving berlin the songs just dont seem as memorable in fact none of the songs were all that special and i cant recall any of them even though i just saw the movie while this is still a cute and worthwhile film it just lacks the sparkle and magic of some of their other films good but far from great,0,1
121,look as being angloirish i assure you this reviewer is anything but bias but i assure you this is very much an irish film and not english as the last comment seems to have suggested this film was written by neil jorden and conor mcpherson and directed by conor mcpherson too both irish the cast is almost entirely irish it was shot in ireland with an irish crew even michael gambon was born in ireland i remember him joking about it in an interview about this filmmichael cane was evidently brought in to boost box office takings abroadloved the film i just wanted to correct a totally uninformed commentnow on with the review i loved dylan moran have always been a fan of his himself and michael cane formed a surprisingly good double act it was great to see morans range as an actor as he plays several different made up characters during the film i would recommend this film to anyone with an interest in comedy as it represents a fresh quirky and inventive turn in irish feature length chuckle films i laughed a lot what more could you ask for,0,1
141,after seeing naked city and night and the city which is still my favorite dassin i was more than excited to watch his masterpiece oword criterion rififinow i am a little bit disappointed about the storyso i have at least these five questions in my mind1 in the final countdown louis grutter shot from the inside a house the main character tony le stphanois he couldnt know if he is still alive or not but he didnt care about it and ran directly after it outside the house with the money to reach his car so of course tony wasnt dead and shot him big questionmark2 in another important scene the specialist in safes cesar gave directly after the robbery as a present a diamond ring which was a part of the robbery a woman which was working for louis grutter in a night bar stupid because before this character wasnt that stupid and of course louis knew directly that tony planned the jewel robbery small questionmark3after the gangsters behind louis grutter murder mario ferrati and his wifetony and his best friend joe planned a revenge against louis gang at the same time they dont care for the security of joes wife and his five years old child of course louis gang kidnapped the son cheap and simple4 the perfect heist of course this is the best 30min long scene in the whole plot without any word spoken in the whole time but was this a perfect heist comparing with other movies which handle with this theme i could only smile when for example tony was taken a fireextinguisher to banned the alarm also too simple5 the grutter gang went to the house of mario because they knew however the jewels will be there then they murder mario and his wife and then they are not searching for it no they ran directly out of the apartment and more they not observing the apartment after it so tony can go after a while which was the same day inside to take the jewels big questionmarkover all its a good movie because of the brilliant 30min silent heist scene because of the very good cut the end scene in the car through paris is stunning because of a very good actor called jean servais because of this blackwhite fever you will get while watching it because of some other reasons too other user wrote about but please dont tell me this is a stunning story,0,1
164,this movie has to be my favorite of all time its not supposed to have a plot because its makers wanted people charlie sheen i thinkto believe it was a real snuff film this was an exercise in visual effects and doesnt cut away when the action happens like every other film does movies these days are now all about sound effects leaving the visuals to be made by computers cause its easier to deal with cgi blood there still are movie makers who still cant get fake blood to look like the real thing there is no rape scene because that wasnt the point of making the film have you seen the hills have eyes 2 the rape scene was funny instead of shocking although im sure there are some gonzo porn film makers that have tried to marry porn with horror but since they probably suck at making films they probably wouldnt be able to pull it off the movie baise moi has a disturbing rape scene because the actresses are actually porn stars and they show everything even though the movie overall sucksits too bad that a movie cant be made without thinking of the money aspect of it all especially when talking about an ao or nc17 rating im sure eli roth has the abilitytalent to make his hostel film series much much better but he has too tame it down to get an r ratingor at least i hope that his movies sucked because of these limitationswatch traces of death or more than smashed pumpkins if you want no frills real footage accident crime scenesfootage dont forget that this movie was made in 1985 the fact that this film can still stand up against most crap made these days says a lot about this film that would be like someone saying the 8bit super mario brothers sucks because the ps3 has better graphics,0,1
173,of life in some colleges of course there were artistic licenses taken but some of what you saw in this film go on in some collegesi went to colleges in southern california where the races pretty much hang around with their own its funny because these are schools that want racial unity equality etc and i can honestly say that its there but the thing is when class lets out or when theyre just hanging out waiting for class they students seem to just hang around with people of their own race or ethnicity is that bad not really everyone needs a feeling of belonging but like the school paper of one of the schools i attended once wrote about that we should all try to hang around with students of other ethnicities and try to know them otherwise youre creating your own segregationracism certainly existed in one of those schools i attended one time someone put leaflets around campus talking about the glories of the aryan race and had the symbols of some of those racist organizations fortunately nothing happened like the incident in the movie where the young caucasian man went off and started shooting at a multiculturalism gatheringi can only hope and pray that nothing like that ever will happenso is higher learning overly dramatic exaggerated maybe is it way off mark it depends on where you went to or go to school the race thing where the ethnicities just hang around with their own does happen minus the hollywood exaggerations the race thing hit pretty close to home for me,0,1
180,its hard to imagine a director capable of such godawful crap as notting hill pulling off something as sensitive and as attractive as this but well heres the evidence and its quite compelling several have alluded to tv drama and yes this does have a seventies play for today feel at times but is always a cut above mainly i think owing to some quite superlative acting from anne reid and to a fine script which shadowboxes with clich without ever getting one on the nose except maybe right at the end i didnt like either the tracking shot of indifferent goodbyes through the hallway nor the ohwhatabeautifulmorning final scene she deserved a more studied finale than that i think after all that hard work the slippers business was a bit ott too on reflectionwhat i mean about avoiding clich well i for one had a sinking expectation that the mature man mays daughter tries to set her up with would be cast in 2 dimensions as a repulsive old bore so as to point the contrast more painfully with the attractive virile young geezer he is unwittingly competing with instead we get an unexpectedly subtle and sympathetic cameo of a lonely clumsy not entirely unlikeable and very human fellow who nevertheless doesnt have much of a clue about entertaining a woman it was around that point i started to sit up and pay more attention here was a script that let the actors breathe and do something interesting with fairly minor parts almost mike leigh in that respect minus the contrived catharses that the latter inexplicably goes in forand of course i was as everyone probably was dumbfounded by what anne reid does with her character and with her body shes not the repressed dutiful housewife discovering herself for the first time this is far too simplistic for the character we have again and again there are allusions to her having been a bad housewife not to mention that thing she does with trays trying to look nurturing and comely and only succeeding in looking awkward the daughter accuses her of having sat in front of the tv all day instead of well whatever her motherly duties might be presumed to have been she has no answer she never was a model wife and mother at least not to herself thats where a lot of the poignancy comes from the sense of someone having wasted a life trying to fulfil a role she simply wasnt good at ever,0,1
197,despite of the success in comedy or drama the turkish directors are failure in horrorthriller okuldbbe are good examples for the awful horror turkish filmsbut if you watch gen you will understand that it is a strike the atmosphere of the movie is impressive and dark also the special features are colorful and not cheap the soundtracks fit the movie but the script is not totally perfect and the theme of the movie is ordinaryas a result gen does not add any difference to horror movies but it does not disappoint thriller fans in this respect it is a success for yesilcam and turkey 710,0,1
211,had this been the original 1914 version of tess of the storm country also starring mary pickford i probably would have rated it a lot higher as this sort of extreme melodrama and sentimentality was pretty typical of the teens however by 1922 this film was already starting to show its age and compared to many of ms pickfords other films such as daddy longlegs sparrows my best girl and suds tess comes up a tad shortand not every pickford film merits a 10 even if she was americas sweetheart now this isnt to say that its a bad filmit certainly isnt but i just cant see how so many have given this film a 10the film has a very long and complicated plotespecially because most films of the era were shorter a rich old crank builds a mansion at the top of a hill next to the river at the bottom of the hill are some dirty squatters who he hates but who he cannot evict so he tries to come up with a variety of ways to get them off the land one ends up in tragedy when his daughters fianc is killed in a scuffle with the po folks the man accused of the murder is dear old marys father though he is innocent to make things a lot worse the only witness to the real murder wont talk and the dead man had gotten his fiance pregnant so at this point we have an innocent man in prison waiting to be executed and a pregnant lady afraid to tell her sanctimonious father she is in the family way theres a ton more to the film such as the cranks son falling in love with mary but its best you just see the film for yourselfthe film excels in some ways the plot while very complicated is also rather interesting and the cinematography is topnotch the very final scene is also pretty cute however there is so much overt sentimentality you can practically cut it with a knife mary is so good and so sweet and so plucky at times the viewer might find it all a bit hard to take while it worked great in 1922 making her the biggest star in the world today its very dated this is not true of all her films but this one certainly isby the way the image entertainment dvd is of decent quality though a few scenes are badly degradedsomething that isnt very surprising considering the age of the film also the only extras included are a brief filmography,0,1
221,as a rule there are few things more dispiriting than hollywoods attempts to be courageous mixing caution with heavyhandedness message movies pat themselves loudly on the back for daring to tackle major problems crossfire is not entirely free from this taint it includes a sermon on the nature of senseless hatred that is embarrassingly obvious assuming a level of naivity in its audience thats depressing to contemplate as late as 1947 it was a big deal for a movie to announce that antisemitism existed and that it was bad it was unthinkable of course for hollywood to address the real subject of the book on which the movie was basedits victim was a homosexual nevertheless thanks to good writing and excellent acting crossfire remains a persuasive examination of what we would now call a hate crimepostwar malaise was one of the major components of film noir and crossfire addresses it directly the film is set in washington dc among soldiers still in uniform but idle spending their days playing poker and barcrawling joseph samuels sam levene an intelligent and kindly jew explains that the end of the war has created a void all the energy that went into hating and fighting the enemy is now unfocused and bottled up samuels meets three soldiers in a bar the sensitive mitchell who is close to a nervous breakdown the weakwilled floyd bowers and montgomery a tall overbearing bully who nastily belittles a young soldier from tennessee as a stupid hillbilly the three soldiers wind up at samuels apartment where the drunken monty becomes increasingly abusive calling his host jewboy samuels is beaten to death and mitchell disappears making himself the prime suspect for the killingunraveling the crime are detective finlay robert young dry and bythebook and sergeant keeley robert mitchum a thoughtful and experienced friend who knows mitchell is incapable of murder among the pieces of the puzzle are ginny gloria grahame a nightclub hostess who met mitchell and gave him her apartment key and floyd steve brodie who as a witness to the crime holes up terrified in a seedy rooming house while there is no real whodunit suspense the story remains gripping and the trap laid for the killer is extremely cleverthe strong noir atmosphere saves the movie from feeling didactic or sanctimonious the cinematography is a striking shadowplay with inky darks and harsh lights rooms often lit by a single lamp filtered by cigarette smoke worldweariness is as pervasive as noir lighting nothing interests me finlay says quietly to nothing is ginnys toast in the nightclub gloria grahame the paragon of noir femininity nearly steals the movie with her two scenes platinumblonde jaded and caustic shes the quintessential bgirl poisoned by the stinking gin mill where she works for laughs she says bitterly her sweet face curdling when mitchell tells her that she reminds him of his wife now and then a wistful kindness peeks through her defensive shell as when she dances with mitchell in a deserted courtyard then offers to cook him spaghetti at her apartment when he goes there he meets a weasely crumplefaced man paul kelly who seems to sponge off ginny and whose conversation is a dense layering of lies and false confessions gloria blows mitchells goodgirl wife off the screen in a scene where shes asked to give mitchell an alibi slim and frail in her bathrobe with her girlish lisp she lets us see just how often ginny has been insulted and dismissed as a tramprobert young is a nondescript actor and he stands no chance against mitchums charisma but he does a good job of keeping his pipesmoking character saddled with delivering the movies earnest message this side of pompousness mitchum meanwhile gets some cool dialogue but not nearly enough to do still even when hes doing nothing but lounging in a corner you cant take your eyes off him the third robert ryan creates a fully shaded and frighteningly convincing portrait of an ignorant unstable bigot we see his phony geniality his bullying his resentment of anyone with advantages his am i right or am i right smugness how easily he slaps labels on people and what satisfaction he gets from despising themcrossfires message seems cautious and dated now though not nearly so much as the same years a gentlemans agreement finlays speech about bigotry cops out by reaching back a hundred years for an instance of white victimhood reminding us that irish catholics were once persecuted next it could be people from tennessee he says or men who wear striped neckties or maybe blacks or japanese or homosexuals or communists the script seems afraid to mention any real contemporary problems it sweetens its message by making the jewish victim saintly as though his innocence were not sufficient and it takes care to exonerate the military having a superior officer declare that the army is ashamed of men like montgomery and stressing that samuels served honorably in the war still it did take some guts to depict immediately after world war ii an american who might have been happier in the nazi army and the movies basic premise is still valid if monty were alive today he would have gone out on september 12 2001 and beat up a sikh,0,1
234,romeo and juliet had been interpreted in so many ways but very few of the versions captured the essance of the play the ony ones i can think of that really nail the romances spirit were west side story and beleive it or not troma films tromeo and juliet at first glance this is another mere splatterfest and many would think it bastardizes the shakespearian classic however the film has an honest feel about it updated to appeal to the sickminded youth of today of course but not without merit yes the frequent dismemberments body piercings car crashes lesbian sex scenes masturbation and incest are in bad taste but whats the harm when you have such a sweet love story as the foundation as bad as most of the acting in this film is i mean it is troma after all the two leads have some genuine chemistry more so than in bigbudget monstrosities titanic and star wars episode two theres a great deal of modernization but much of the original text is in tact especially when tromeo and juliet are together theres a great scene where juliet utters the famous parting is such sweet sorrow and tromeo quickly follows in midnineties grunge fashion yeah it totally sucks i think its truly unfortunate that this film isnt going to get the recognition or the wide release that it deserves i hop that people who see this on the video store shelves wont be turned off by the grossmess in the movie because theyd be missing out on quite a subversive expereience,0,1
235,every time the supposed explorers and we the audience is primed to set its first sights one of the wonderous new worlds for some ungodly reason the filmmakers decided to distract with an emergency or some false alarm or some bit of artificial dramatic suspense so instead of calmly enjoying the surface of io or standing over the rings of saturn or concentrating on the magic of flying by a comet or an asteroid we are distracted into worrying about the wellbeing and survival of the characters big let down the filmmakers seem to be unsure what they want a documentary of the natural wonders in our solar system or a suspense thriller in which the viewer cares more about the characters than the subject matter come on hello if i wanted suspense and tension id watch a real narrative scifi movie sure its a docudrama but the characters and their survival here the risks of such a mission should be secondary to the subject matter wait yes the risks of such a mission are an important part of the subject matter since essentially this is a film about a space mission not just about the solar system but it was overplayed and distracted strongly from the discovery of new worlds we were supposed to be enjoying otherwise the film was remarkable in giving a very realistic feel for the human elements of a space mission the squabbles the tensions the weight of responsibility the nearfatal mistakes the sacrifices etc also it would fit very well in the hardscifi subgenre in fact it would be one of the best because here the science was almost closely adhered to but the distractions were awful otherwise i missed showing the effects of being in space for several years on the astronauts after landing on earth also not,0,1
255,my friend had the idea of watching the animated lotr after seeing the peter jackson return of the king so i finally bought it off ebay thinking right from the start it was going to suck actually it really wasnt as bad as i thought it would be the animation was good for its time they used a unique method of blending live action with animation to create some interesting effects and the guy who did the voice for frodo sounded somewhat like elijah woodnot the greatest adaptation of a book but trust me ive seen a lot worse it skips quite a lot of things since both fellowship and the two towers are compressed into one two hour movie definatley worth a watch kids might like but still absoutley no comparision with the peter jackson trilogy,0,1
266,woaww is it only now that you notice the links between all the characters of course its libby and for the guy in the hatch with desmond any deja vu yeah he was the same guy that gave money to sayid after hes killed or tortured the other soldier in the episode 14th of the 2nd season one of them well actually its not completely the same guy hes named joe in the 14th episode and kelvin in the last 2 episodes twins who knows jj abrams mmmm im not even sure of that there are hundreds of links like this one between all the charactersbut that was just in response to the libby commenti found those 2 episodes far more interesting than the whole season 2 during all that season i felt that there was lots of things ive missed and very few things ive learned especially at the very beginning the 1st episode of the 2nd season is excellent and then the 2nd one is a kind of flash back of the 1st one i found that disappointing even if im pretty sure that everything in lost tend to have a meaning that was just an example of how i was frustrated watching those episodeslets go back to the last 2 episodes i think weve learned more new things in those 2 episodes than in the entire season but all we learn are little pieces for the next puzzle like the involvement of desmonds relatives sorry if i spoil too much believe me or not im trying not to for example so lots of things evoked in the past 2 seasons are still unclear or have been developed once then nothing and still theres new material as if all the holes in the picture were not enough we all want to see the big picture of all of it of course but i think well have to be very very patient i hope there will be only 3 seasons im not sure i will watch more than 3 seasons anyway there was also lots of actions in the very last episode and a good cliffhanger at the very endso basically yes i loved that last episode and yes i want to see the third season,0,1
283,for all those bewildered by the length and pace of this film like why does he show spaceships docking for like 15 minutes heres a word you might want to think aboutbeauty beauty is an underrated concept sure youll often see nice photography and so on in films but when did you last see a film that contains beauty purely for the sake of it there is a weird belief among cinemagoers that anything which is not plot or character related must be removed this is depressing hogwash there is nothing wrong with creating a beautiful sequence that has nothing to do with the films plot a director can show 15 minutes of spaceships for no reason than that they are beautiful and it is neither illegal nor evil to do so 2001 requires you to watch in a different way than you normally watch films it requires you to relax it requires you to experience strange and beautiful images without feeling guilty that there is no complex plot or detailed characterization dont get me wrong plots and characters are good but theyre not the beall and endall of everything there are different kinds of film and to enjoy 2001 you must tune your brain to a different wavelength and succumb to the pleasure of beauty pure beauty unfettered by the banal conventions of everyday films all art is quite useless oscar wilde,0,1

300,this movie starts off as a college tna flick but turns pretty ugly after the main characters sister is gang raped by a biker gang driving a van it has a pretty good pace and james van patten does a pretty good job in this cannon tax writeoff movie this was the first movie i ever saw at the parkway drivein here in toronto the main feature was alphabet city and young warriors was the added feature out of the 2 movies young warriors was by far more entertaining and memorable if you are a fan of blow em up excessively violent movies this one would make a great addition to any collection,0,1
323,its hard for me to criticize anything that mitzi kapture does she just radiates beauty and grace on the screen and is a phenomenal actress that notwithstanding yes the plot was predictable i think perhaps if jill had slept with richard then it may have made him a little crazier than he already was which would have added more to the suspense it would have also been nice to see jill and her husband find out about richards little problem with his exwife maybe a bit more back story i was a little disappointed with the ending of the movie i would have liked to have seen more closure with zacks death and possibly closure with her husband i do have to say though i will never be able to look at a flare gun and not picture her standing there it was a very fitting end for richard of course mitzi rocked i am so looking forward to her future projects,0,1
345,but the opposite sorry bud i completely understand how you can be dragged into a film because you relate to the subject and you have this film is terrible the main character would give any charlie brown subtitler a run for his money he just constantly mumbles which is always a laugh most scenes just feel awkward with characters more often than not gazing across to another with a look ofits your line now then i will react best british comedy please buddy have a strong word with your bad bad selfat the end of the day the sun goes downand this film is awful i mean well done to the people involvedthey have made a filmand maybe motorbike enthusiasts may be into it but people that still live here on earth with an actual sense of humour will struggle with this more than smiling at the christmas present theyre nan bought themwas that overly harsh i do apologise,0,1
349,betty is an understudy for the lead in a production of verdis macbeth when a car mysteriously hits the lead betty is thrust into the spotlight opening night is a smashing success and betty decides to leave the afterparty to celebrate in private with her boyfriend but when the boyfriend leaves the room betty is grabbed from behind by an unknown blackgloved masked figure the unknown assailant ties betty to a column gags her and places needles under her eyes that will cause incredible damage and pain should betty close them the boyfriend returns to the room and is stunned to see betty in such a predicament hes even more shocked when the killer grabs him and shoves a knife through his lower jaw with such force the tip of the knife can clearly be seen in his mouth and betty has been forced to watch all of this so begins bettys terrifying ordeal with a killer not just intent on hurting her but also on forcing her to watch as he mutilates her friendsopera gets classified as a giallo but to me it differs in quite a few ways from the model less emphasis is placed on the mystery elements of the story than in something like argentos tenebre or the bird with the crystal plumage the blackgloved masked killer may be omnipresent but the clues and red herrings normally associated with a good giallo are absent instead opera is all about the tension of an unknown killer and making the audience uncomfortable the focus is on the grisly death scenes bettys fear and the killers obsession with bettyopera features what i think are some of argento most artistic death scenes when the killer grabs betty after her boyfriend leaves the room youre sure that bettys had it but the sadistic killer only wants to force betty to watch as he brutally stabs her lover in the neck the knife emerging in his mouth its a well shot and designed scene and those needles in the eyes brilliant or take the death of the seamstress at first her death seems like an ordinary runofthemill murder but when the seamstress accidentally swallows the killers locket what started out as just another death scene turns it up a notch as the killer uses a pair of scissors to cut the girls throat open to get his chain finally theres the most famous death scene in opera that im amazed with each time i see it mira is shot in the eye while peering through a keyhole that scene displays a lot of what i like about argento its got style to burn as implausible as it may be its creative memorable and a blast to watchargento certainly wasnt the first italian director to concentrate on eye mutilation but in opera hes taken eye trauma to a new level needles holding eyes open a bullet in the eye and ravens pecking out an eye are all part of argentos vision pun intended and these scenes do have the effect that i believe argento was going for the first time i saw the killer putting those needles in bettys eyes i couldnt stop blinking it actually had a physical effect on me what is it about the eyes that make them such a target for abuse in italian films to be fair and not sound like such a fanboy there are problems i have with opera that keep me from rating it as argentos best one of my problems is with the air duct system running through bettys apartment building while i dont doubt there are air duct systems in older apartment buildings that connect the apartments the ducts in opera are huge im no expert but i sincerely doubt any building like the one in this movie would have had such mammoth air ducts it doesnt seem practical at all and dont you think someone would have done something about them long ago to keep criminals and nosey neighbors out of the other apartments its convenient for the plot but its not very realisticbut i suppose my major problem with the film comes with the finale whats up with that ending it feels totally out of place tacked on and like a bad afterthought im not sure what else to say other than its horrible,0,1
356,its initial premise is based on the american civil war but its ultimately a love story we start at the beginning of the war where the main characters kidman law are obviously aware of each other and theres an obvious attraction they have a passionate kiss on the day he leaves for the war the main thrust of this film is for laws character to return to kidmans and his struggles to achieve that and her struggles to survive until he returns the reason it fails to convince is that we dont see enough of this relationship before laws character leaves for battle its difficult to believe the premise that 2 people yearn for each other so much given theyve had so little contact everything else is just about fine renee zellweger and her incumbent father and his entourage are lovely additions as is the threat from the gang chasing deserters sure its a long film but it does hold the interest and the cinematography is great an honourable attempt that doesnt quite make it but worth a watch nonetheless,0,1

385,im going to make this short and sweet its not surprising that you had no use for this film this is a story about the power beauty and possibilities inherent in a meaningful education based on your pathetically composed comments i can see that your own education has been woefully neglected or worse completely wasted your comments are those of a truly ignorant person i would advise you to do something about this condition but in your case i feel its probably too late my hope is that you yourself dont intend to go into the teaching profession especially in film studies because you could only do damage oh one last bit of advice in the future if you intend to write more opinion pieces you should really proofread your work it will make people take you more seriously,0,1

396,the 80s is largely considered the decade in which horror decided to have fun sometimes there were some definite brains behind it all evil dead ii night of the creeps and return of the living dead for example and then there were those movies that were mindless but had a definite low rent charm and were perfect for a night with beer and friends movies like pieces and blood diner stacked rental shelves in the 80s and 90s offering little in intelligence or craftsmanship but plenty in dumb entertainment kevin tenneys 1988 movie night of the demons is a part of this traditionstupid poorly acted and not an original bone in its body but dammit if you dont have a good timethe plot is so simplistic it just had to come from the 80s a group of dumb teens played by a bunch of actors in their mid to late 20s decide to go to a party at hull house thrown by angela mimi kinkade and suzanne scream queen legend linnea quigley well angela and co decide to throw a sance this turns out to be as will arnetts arrested development character gob would call it a huge mistake because a demonic force soon possesses angela and starts to get to the others as welltake the evil dead a nightmare on elm street and your average dumb dead teen flick throw them in a blender and night of the demons is what you get the movie is anything but original and really its not a good movie the whole thing is insanely derivative the acting is terrible the jokes often fall flat the characters are annoying especially the character of stooge and the plot holes are numerous that out of the way its still a lot of fun so why well for one thing the make up and gore effects are top notch with some really memorable moments especially a nasty and just plane odd bit with a tube of lipstick that really stick out it also rarely if ever takes itself too seriously yet with the exception of some terrible puns plays it straight and never wastes the audiences time with winking self awareness plus theres a definite energy and enthusiasm to the whole enterprise thats almost impossible to resist yeah its nothing special but it knows that and it couldnt be more proud of that fact its a goofy party horror movie and it never pretends to be anything moreit might not be a classic but night of the demons is a good example of horror junk food done right it might not be too memorable or original but sometimes you dont want a fancy beer sometimes you want a budweiser,0,1
414,lifeforce is an extremely schizophrenic movie based on colin wilsons novel the space vampires the script ignores most of the novels concepts and structure indeed it owes more to the quatermass serials than the novel but the scenes it does leave in from the novel are nearly identical to those in the film and talking of the script it must be one of the most uneven in cinema history its though it was written in chapters by several different people take for instance carlson he disappears after the early shuttle scenes which led me to believe he was dead then he turns up again halfway through the film in order to explain the plot to the beleaguered brits and its this lack of attention by the screenwriters that spoils the film and theres plenty of other clumsy scripting such as the heroes returning to london in a helicopter and not realising it has been over run by zombies untill theyre flying over it i could go on at great length about these plot holes but lifeforce is actually enjoyable to watch as long as you dont use your brain its good to see a scifi horror film from an era when aliens were portrayed as being cute creatures that children hid in their bedrooms so that nasty human adults wouldnt get their hands on them the special effects and pyrotechnics are very very good theres lots of action and stunts and lifeforce features one of the most memorable aliens in the form of the space girl when mentioning lifeforce in conversation with males its always a race to say seen the alien in lifeforce she can suck the lifeforce out of me anytime hardly surprising looking at the demographics of the votes that this film is more popular with males than females dont worry a naked girl cant escape from here cant she pity,0,1
427,my 5 year old daughter is very into the barbie series of movies ive had mixed feelings about that not wanting her to buy into the whole barbiedoll image of things and recognizing that the movies are a marketing ploy to convince young girls to buy more dolls and make more money for mattel this morning though she asked me to watch this movie with her and it being a lazy saturday morning and with not much else to do i agreed i dont know if the movies have been made to help market the dolls which seem to be losing their appeal a bit from what ive heard or if the dolls are there to market the movies or more likely a bit of both but whichever is the case i have to admit somewhat to my surprise this wasnt half badits a fun and imaginative story full of magical places and people and memorable characters both good and evil essentially annika played by barbie has to find a way to build a wand of light to reverse the evil spells of the wizard wenlock who among other things has turned her sister into a flying horse and her parents into stone the animation here was pretty good not disneycalibre if one thinks of disney as the standard to aspire to but generally pretty good and while the movie is obviously tailored to young girls rather than middleaged men i still found there were enough twists and turns to make me wonder how it was all going to turn out its true that there were some holes in the story or at least some logical inconsistencies but again one must remember the target audience who wouldnt really think of such things this is an all around decent family movie 710,0,1
442,when braveheart first came out i was enthralled and was admittedly one of the most rabid fans of the film when rob roy came out i was intrigued and although i enjoyed the film i did not think it was a great film however as time has gone by my appreciation for rob roy has grown and my enthusiasm for braveheart has diminished braveheart is great entertainment to be sure but there are flaws as well the most significant in my view is the unflattering portrayal of robert the bruce who was without a doubt scotlands greatest king another is the historical inaccuracy of the film which tarnishes the film in proportion to the many historical distortions i think i am also bothered by the fact that it was in this film seen only at least by me in retrospect that the beginnings of mel gibsons egomania can be seen clearly for the first time in contrast rob roy has grown on me over the years partly because it largely avoids the faults i mind most in braveheart but also because rob roy is like fine wine growing more mature and complex with each viewing,0,1
469,although kris kristofferson is good in this role who wouldnt want to see elvis pressly instead with the drug addiction and the fall from supreme fame may have scared away elvis agent to be apart of the movie it was a mistake this would have been a perfect movie for elvis even though the soundtrack is far from terrific paul williams and barbra streisand do a decent job in creating an original soundtrack for this period piece musical somewhat of a love story this is more of a drama about the fall from grace and the gift of redemption like is most tragedies the hero of the story was die also gary busey is once again perfect in a not so perfect role,0,1
474,before this the flawed slaughterhouse five was the best but this screen adaptation of mother night is very true to the book and keeps the comedy mystery and tragedy intent thankfully it wasnt hollywoodized or idiotized a la the movie of breakfast of champions another good thing about this movie is that you dont have to be familiar with the book to follow it as i think you do for slaughterhouse five thats probably true of breakfast of champions also but they did such a bad job of that youre better off just reading the book and not seeing the movie nick nolte did an excellent job in this film,0,1

487,another handheld horror means another divisive movie that fans should still seek out and make up their own minds aboutimagine a cross between the blair witch project and the grudge and youre close to the overall content of this movie its another videotaped horror but this time most of it is edited together in readiness for a video doc that was never completed by a supernatural investigator who disappearedi certainly had a feeling of dread while watching this movie does anyone do dreadful better than our asian friends but the creepy moments the genuinely creepy moments were sadly a bit fewer and farther between than i had hoped i also felt that i was two or three steps ahead of the investigator when apparent revelations appeared throughout so i certainly cant recommend this as highly as rechaving said that it would be remiss of me not to highly recommend any film that goes on at length about ectoplasmic worms contains at least two subtly spooky ghost moments and made sure that i had to put the lights back on for a while when the sun went downcheck it out if you have been enjoying some of the other handheld genre releases of late and the finale is a hairraising doozysee this if you like the last broadcast pulse angel heart,0,1
490,this is a generally nice film with good story great actors and great songs the cinematography was unfortunately bad one of the films weakest points is the annoying chain of sequences copied from pretty woman why does it hurt to attempt some originality abbas mustan anyonethe film is about a newly married couple raj and priya salman rani priya cannot conceive after an accident she had during the previous pregnancy and they finally decide to use a surrogate mother who will carry their child they pick madhubala a vulgar prostitute played by preity zinta the film is not really realistic i mean isnt it easier to adopt and even if they pick a girl does it mean the man has to sleep with her have you heard of insemination anyway i guess if the writers had heard of all this the film wouldnt have been made so the concept is apparently intentionalsalman acts very well its nice to see him playing a serious character but his character suffers from unnecessary and cheap dialogues about his great love to his wife and how hard he finds it to sleep with another woman come on its cheesy and unrealistic rani is just about ok she is generally effective and does try to do something with the role but gets completely overshadowed by preity zintathe film belongs to preity who steals the show in a big way with her flawless performance she makes the transformation from a loud prostitute to a sensitive woman easily and naturally she lives the film emotes and makes you love her and admire her at the same time partly because of her role partly because of her magnetic and positive personality this is one of her careerbest performances there is no doubt she is more talented than her industry contemporaries she just should do more such rolesthe films ending only highlights what i said above it is tearjerking exciting and very wellacted watch it for preity710 for the film 1010 for preity,0,1
493,my interpretation is that the term distant is used in the sense of the opposite of warm people who are not warm toward others the film reminds me of the teachings of the dalai lama in the art of happiness where his main point is that the key to happiness is connecting with others not only are the characters in the film insular but they are also humorless charmless shy quiet and unfriendly these characteristics appear to prevent them amongst other things from forming and enjoying relationships and being able to talk about and deal with their problems and as a result they are terribly unhappy i see it as a strong vindication of the dalai lamas teaching im not a buddist by the way if you are one of the people who thinks that their behavior is a natural response to living in a large city then i think you may be right but i recommend the dalai lamas book city life need not be like thisi can see why some people found it boring it does drag a bit in places and the characters are not particularly likable and it does contrast to lost in translation where the insular characters are much more likable and do connect with one another even though they dont connect with people generally,0,1
501,four daughters begins as just another clone of little women type melodrama a single father with four musically talented eligible daughters has his hands full trying to keep them in line and guide them in their courting rituals what turns the film around is the sudden appearance of a new hollywood star some critics say the first antihero long before james dean graced the big screen from the time the dark foreboding figure of mickey borden john garfield appears at ann lemps priscilla lane gate splashing his selfpity and doomed philosophy on the rest of the cast four daughters becomes much more than just a chick flickthough garfield is the main reason to watch four daughters there are other flashes of brilliance to enjoy hungarianborn director michael curtiz later responsible for such gems as casablanca and mildred pierce pinpoints certain images with his camera aided by cinematographer ernest haller of rebel without a cause fame that sticks in the viewers mind for example the screeching gate that anns first suitor felix deitz jeffrey lynn swings on so merrily becomes symbolic of the shifts in moods and affections by those who use itthat garfield delivers the standout performance is obvious but the rest of the cast keeps up with him most of the way the underrated jeffrey lynn plays his role to perfection as the neglected suitor whose love for his cherished ann never falters even when shes with another man claude rains somewhat miscast as the father of the four comingofage young women gives a fine portrayal of a set upon doting family head who gets lost in the shuffle the three lane sisters already famous for their musical abilities turn into accomplished actresses playing their parts well a raft of supporting actors including dick foran frank mchugh may robson and eddie acuff makes it all believablehow opposites attract is part of the ploy for touching the quick of the viewers imagination ann is the eternal optimist even when she and mickey are down and out she always looks on the bright side and like so many caught in the pliers of the great depression in those days she saw prosperity just around the corner mickey recites an entire list of bad things that have happened to him seeking company in his misery from ann which ann refuses to do mickey expects to go out with a bolt of lightning striking him dead as he rounds the corner of life mickey has meager talent as a composer ann has talent to spare as a singer and musician ann is big on beauty mickey is big on personality in a warped sense of a way and the differences go on and on how all this is reconciled in the end is an important part of the movie not to be missedsee four daughters for john garfields doozy of an acting debut on the big screen the only time he was better came seven years later when he again mesmerized the film goers with one of the greatest screen performances ever as frank chambers in the postman always rings twice opposite the equally charismatic lana turner but also watch four daughters to catch important elements that may be missed if too much concentration is placed on the star of the show,0,1

611,one has to be careful whom one tells about watching 12hour long films it could become easy for people to assume that this is some kind of regular occurrence in fact even in the world of arthouse cinema such mammoth running times are extremely rare for obvious reasons this is one thing that hollywood and art cinema share in common the generally accepted running time of 90120 minutes with a minority of movies that dare to approach but rarely exceed the threehour markfor this reason a film like out 1 runtime 729 minutes is a challenge for even the most hardened cinephile and it goes some way in explaining why it has only ever been screened on a handful of occasions and remains extremely hard to findoriginally devised as a tv series by maverick nouvelle vague director jacques rivette it raised little interest from the french networks and wound up being given a brief theatrical run instead peter watkins was forced to do much the same with his brilliant nuclear war pseudo documentary the war game although that had more to do with state censorship than issues with running time shown a couple of times in 1971 out 1 has reemerged at a handful of rivette retrospectives over the last two decades and many who have seen it including esteemed us critic jonathan rosenbaum have acclaimed it as one of the greatest films of all timeis it well yes if you like rivette that alone is a big if as jacques rivette has never been a commercially successful director only two of his films were hits celine and julie go boating 1974 and la belle noiseuse 1991 both superb and many remain difficult to find on dvd today out 1 only recently became available over the internet after a rare videotape was uploaded nevertheless he is greatly respected within the film community and with good reason his playfully surreal narratives sense of pacing and use of improvisation set him apart as one of cinemas most unique and satisfying filmmakersout 1 deals with a theme that reoccurs throughout rivettes work the nature of acting particularly in the context of theatre and improvisation his fascination with acting make rivettes films a far more collaborative process than many of his contemporaries as the improvisational aspects allow actors to have a far more active role in determining how the film comes together out 1 is roughly divided into four major narratives gradually intertwining and blurring as the film develops two consisting of acting troupes each trying to devise postmodern theatrical adaptations of aeschylus plays the other two individual petty thieves played by nouvelle vague icons jeanpierre laud and juliet berto pursuing eccentric methods of making money and an overarching plot involving a mysterious balzacinspired conspiracy centred around an organisation known as the thirteenas with any rivette film featuring a conspiracy narrative the mysteries and secret organisations are little more than a red herring as the characters are slowly explored and revealed and their plans and interpersonal connections break down the film becomes increasingly symbolic of post1968 ennui and the decline of the ideals of that era for a film made in 1971 these were remarkably prescient themes another french director in jean eustache would tackle this topic equally satisfyingly in his 1973 masterpiece the mother and the whore but this is not the limit of out 1s scope comprised of eight episodes of roughly 90 minutes each the beginning of each episode has a brief abstract blackandwhite still montage of the events of the previous chapter out 1 is no less watchable than any quality tv series and may even be better experienced on a oneepisode atatime basis this is not to say that it doesnt remain challenging even when viewed in segments like most rivette films it uses the first few hours to simply establish the characters before embarking on the plot of sorts and some of those early scenes particularly the sequences depicting the actors heavily abstracted exercises seem interminably long these scenes are important however not just as an exploration of the improvisational acting methods that play both a literal and a metaphorical role in the film but as a method of adjusting the viewer to the somewhat languorous pace of the film paradoxically long takes make long films far more tolerable for an audience and this understanding of pacing has led rivette along with more modern directors like michael haneke and bla tarr to create films with less commercial runningtimes that nevertheless retain the capacity to leave viewers enthralledin a film that is in many ways about acting the acting is fantastic many famous nouvelle vague faces appear including the aforementioned laud and berto the outstanding michel lonsdale and rivette regular bulle ogier even another legendary director in eric rohmer has a great cameo as a balzac professor who appears in a pivotal scene the people and architecture of paris c 1971 though seem to have an equally significant role the city landscapes crowd scenes and interested onlookers freeze out 1 in time a document of a place at a point in historyafter a little more than 720 minutes the film ends on an impossibly brief enigmatic note yet the exhausting journey that the viewer has taken is so full of possibilities intricacy and spontaneity that one would be forgiven for wanting to start all over again from the beginning or see the next twelve hours in the lives of these characters for those who have watched many kinds of cinema and think they have seen everything the art form has to offer out 1 is a reminder that cinema has the potential to be so many more things and diverge in so many more directions than current conventions allow for filmmakers film critics and artists of all disciplines this is something to be cherished,0,1
637,whenever i hear a movie being touted because it has no sex violence bad language special effects and so on my bs detector goes off usually a movie like that is sentimental hogwash which panders to people who dont want anything to surprise them but to affirm how superior they are to us craven folk so when david lynchs the straight story began getting those kinds of reviews i was apprehensive especially since i was not a fan of his other uplifting story the elephant man for all the stunning images and the good acting in that film it seemed more interested in preaching to us than inspiring usi neednt have worried the straight story is an honest movie rather than a saccharine one most of that is due to the fact that lynch and writers john roach and mary sweeney tell it straight and simple for the most part there are a couple of homilies by straight i could have done without and the shots of grain being harvested are repeated a little too much but those are only quibbles theres no heavyhanded message no sentimental strings to jerk our emotions and no condescension towards us and its characters instead they depend on the story to build its own power and it does so by the final scene we are genuinely movedof course casting richard farnsworth adds realism to the part he really is someone who looks like hes lived through a lot but still perseveres and except for those homilies the desire he has to get back together with his brother doesnt seem overly sentimental because you can sense here is someone whos lived too long and seen too much to be driven by anger for long and he knows his time is running out so he wants to make some peace not only with his brother but with his life sissy spacek also does fine unmannered work as straights daughter and although i am a city and suburban boy the iowa and wisconsin landscape are beautifully shot making me want at least to visit some day,0,1
660,i cant imagine a director whose thirst for blood and violence is greater than quentin tarantinos at least in his films inglourious basterds is no different we all know tarantino the guy who exploded on the scene in the early 90s with cult classics such as reservoir dogs and pulp fiction since he has been a disappointment for some well i am relieved to say tarantino has not lost his touch he brings us his best since pulp fiction and thankfully sowe know the story a wwii tale told only as tarantino can fictional of course a war film hasnt been done like this before brad pitt as lt aldo raine leads the basterds in nazi occupied france their goal killin nazis christoph waltz as colonel hans landa plays a similar role on the other side hes know as the jew hunter and goes about his business as ruthless as no other the third sub story consists of a young jewish refugee shosanna dreyfus who witnesses the slaughter of her family and she of course wishes to plot revenge on the germans for her devastating lose there actually is three stories here intertwining and connecting with each other if you know anything about tarantino or his films this is nothing new for himwar has never been been so fun the basterds are haunting but at the same time very funny at times even hilarious the dark comedy aspect play a big aspect in this as in many other tarantino films the entertainment and hilarity is led by brad pitt i found him extremely funny and entertaining i couldnt wait to see him on screen again even with his crazy accent he works in this type of film also making great impressions were mlanie laurent and christoph waltz who were tremendous the film was filled with noteworthy performancesthe story itself has so many historical inaccuracies to even count but so what it isnt meant to be a documentary tarantino wanted to have fun with as should we the cinematography department deserves big props with beautiful vibrant colors highlighting the film youve really got to love the last line in the film but pulp fiction remains his masterpiecequentin tarantino among all other things is an entertainer wwii is one of the most tragic events in history but tarantino some how manages to make it fun inglourious basterds is a fun film its tremendously entertaining shocking dramatic suspenseful and funny at the same time jam packed with everything you look for in a movie done with that certain tarantino style its worth being checked out its time to experience for yourself what war is like through the eyes of quentin tarantino,0,1
667,this wrestlemania just didnt do it for me while some things such as the battle royal and involvement of celebrities were a throwback to the good old days so to speak it seemed to be more of a highbrow in your house than anything else above averageworth it for several matches such as the tag team title match although worthy of note is that the title change meant nothing as it was reversed the next night,0,1

828,paulie was cute cool enjoyable and quite fulfilling i went to this movie expecting to view a typical family movie one that within moments would find me unconscious and drooling on the floor my mindframe immediately changed when i was quickly captivated by the movies wholesomeness it is rare that you find a family movie that is thorough and can be coined wholesome most are cheaply made written and produced purely to attract young family members wholl then drag the unfortunate elders to a mind numbing 65 minutes of overused sight gags and plotsoh yes paulie had a plot it told the story of a young girlmarie and her best friend paulie the parrot who unbelievably could talk and quite frequently held conversations with her maries dorky jerk father found this unbelievable and thought paulie to be damaging to his 4year old daughters mental health and quickly tore them apart we follow paulies adventures and misadventures as he attempts to reunite with his beloved owner meeting many memorable characters along the way oh yeah paulie really could smarttalk and had a swift new jersey accent cool the plot held thick and entertaining throughout keeping me attracted paulie is the best family movie i have found and wholeheartedly enjoyed ever seriously pick up a copy and sit back and enjoy a true family movie with the whole family no sleeping i promise,0,1
836,its such a shame that an important film like this is virtually unknowni dont think alan bates has done a better film than thisits never shown on television the only time i can recall it being shown on british tv was in the summer of 1998 i have it on tape but sadly the quality isnt great due to a dodgy aerial at the timei remember wanting to see this film for some time before it appeared on tv it was shown on channel 4 in the early hours of the morning thereby ensuring that it still remained unseen except for a very small audiencei was living in bristol at the time and it was ironic that when i finally saw the film i realised that i had walked past the very house where it was filmed several times before the film treads a fine line a married couple attempting to make light of their tragic predicament of coping with their severely mentally handicapped daughter by laughing about it and even involving the child in their jokesthe direction and the acting are so superb that the film is always compassionate and moving and is never in danger of lapsing into bad tastea couple of years ago i saw a clip of the filmed theatre production with eddie izzard in the role of bri and victoria hamilton playing sheilait showed izzard improvising and larking about and hamilton jokingly telling the audience to ignore him when hes being like thisi maybe taking this out of context as i only saw a brief clip but having read the play and seen the film this is clearly such a delicate subject that such an approach is both insensitive and disrespectfulizzard was praised for his performance but i felt uncomfortable with what i sawit is perhaps surprising that such a successful play failed to find an audience when it was finally filmedthis is one of the best british films of the 70s and hopefully it will be released on dvd one day,0,1

881,i absolutely hate the idea of made for television films for me tvms usually involve jane seymour or jaclyn smith as the mother of a sick child who is dying of a difficult to treat disease all done in such a sugary manner that the audience doesnt need tissues it needs insulin so when deadly voyage a made for tv film by the bbc and hbo based on a true story i vaguely remembered from a couple of years previously turned up on the tv schedules i sat down waiting to be bored senseless i was surprisedno strike that last sentence i wasnt surprised i was shocked here is a tvm that grips you tighter than a great white shark in fact deadly voyage doesnt deserve to be relegated to the tv schedules it should have been made and distributed by a top hollywood film company due its absolutely terrifying premise and whats more its unlike papillon and sleepers completely true for those who dont know the story possible spoilers as to plot sometime in the early 90s a bunch of africans stowed away on an ukrainian freight ship bound for france in order to work there of course it was an attempt at illegal immigration but the crew of the freighter had already been fined for allowing illegal immigrants onto their ship from a previous journey and not wanting to get into anymore trouble with maritime and immigration authorities the crew murder the africans after discovering them hiding in the hold all except one african kingsley ofusu who manages to escape from the firing squad but who must try and survive aboard the ship but the problem is the crew are hunting him and france is still several days voyage away just typing the above paragraph reminds of how good deadly voyage is what a remarkable story and once again it is unlike many stories that claim to be totally true its very well written directed and acted especially by sean pertwee why isnt that guy a big name star and most of all its a tense claustrophobic disturbing thriller that i can still remember vividly six years after seeing it for the one and only time i look forward to seeing again but youve got to ask yourself how can a tvm be better than most of the hollywood action blockbusters that came out round about the same time oh hold on ive just had a disturbing thought about jerry bruickhiemer doing a remake with tony scott directing and with denzil washington playing kingsley brad pitt playing pertwees role massive artistic licence taken with events etc lets keep deadly voyage a superlative tvm rather than a poor blockbuster,0,1
889,hi all i am a chess enthusiast since the age of about 6 i supposed i am quite obsessed by chess but hopefully not as much as the central character in this filmin this film the central character reflects a real chess player called curt von bardeleben who committed suicide in 1924 he is famous for a game he played against steinitz where a beautiful combination was played by steinitz instead of resigning he simply walked out of the tournament hall never to returnthe social ineptness of the central character is unfortunately a treat of some of the more serious grandmasters you sometimes get in chess tournaments chess i suppose is a very big sacrifice and you can sometimes end up imbalanced in other areas of life a major example of this is the chess legend bobby fischer although a genius he was also very disturbed in many waysin the film a world championship match is depicted as between an italian grandmaster and luzhin the format is a knockout which actually the world governing body of fide has sometimes employed as a format itself going from 128 players to just 2 in the final but this was a group knockout which also depicts a realistic format where the winners of each group play against each otherthe position before adjournment makes for a fascinating chess puzzle in itself in fact i have done a youtube video about it for you to explore the winning combination in detail enjoy httpukyoutubecomwatchvxzptdtphwdm best wishes tryfon,0,1
925,i dont know if its fair for me to review this im not a fan of gratuitous violence ive never understood the movie industry making heroes out of mob members and cold blooded killers when the godfather came out i thought they had broken the mold but the decades have produced a series of wellacted mob movies with major stars and directors doing them this one is obviously lowbudget but it is certainly well done at some point in all of these i feel like i want to take a shower if such characters actually exist it is hard for the soul i always intellectualize that humankind will rise above this sort of thing this kind of crud has to be stopped i hope the people that go to films like this are more voyeuristic and less vicarious i feel sort of the same way about slasher movies why do we have a fascination with death and dismemberment in fairness i am judging this on the acting and directing and for what it is it seems to work pretty well,0,1

950,this film was quite a surprise i wasnt expecting much to be honest greta garbos first hollywood film so what probably something rough and with the usual exaggerated armwaving and facial contortions that lowgrade silent films so often showwell was i mistaken greta garbo must have just shocked the studio people as much as she did me because this film made her a star and deservedly so she instinctively understood the power of just standing still or of simply holding a meaningful expression for a long lingering moment so its effect could be felt and not just seen i kept thinking to myself how did this modern actress get into a creaky silent film she was just years and years ahead of her timethe story isnt all that interesting it is the usual tale of love found and lost it is only the performance of garbo as leonora the poor village girl who makes good in the big city and then returns to get the man who got away that gives it life costar ricardo cortez is serviceable but his character is never really developed and he is demeaned by the script throughout at one point he is made to wear garbos clothes leave in a huff then ignominiously return and give them back and lets not even talk about his horrible final scenes with garbo and then his wife way too ordinary he didnt have much of a career after this and i can understand why but he suffices as the somewhat mystifying object of leonoras obsessionthere is one utterly fantastic line in this film that just says it all leonora you are becoming conspicuous yes conspicuous indeedif you really want to know what its all about without seeing the whole film just watch the last 30 seconds or so garbos glance as she sits quite alone in her luxurious car says everything she must be so happy she has everything she wants yes garbos face says it all about that i have to see this one again garbo is just amazing,0,1
955,as with all of angelopoulos films the suspended step of the stork implicitly demands a close and intimate participation on the part of the viewer a fact that has certainly contributed to the limited popularity of his work dialogues are sparing with no monologues or exchanges exteriorizing the characters inner conflicts doubts or feelings the filmmaker prefers to keep the viewers away from their own emotional responses and instead forces them to explore and study the characters identities for themselves as a result the acting is understated and implicit as opposed to overt and explicitthe action scenes are set between long intervals of contemplation where the viewer is asked to become a participant to participate as an actor by probing his or her own psyche as in a novel where the drama rests entirely on the authors writing to provide a template where the readers imagination andor past experience flourish angelopoulos drama rests within his images his uses of the long shots the long takes the leisurely pacing the sparing dialogues that have become his trademark inviting the viewer to experience the film from his or her personal perspective angelopoulos uses silence to capture moments of high intensity reverting to the nonverbal language of gestures gazes sounds and music when he believes that words can only take us so farthe music by angelopoulos long time collaborator eleni karaindrou provides more than just a discreet background but becomes itself a dramatic element of the story a large part of the film consists of exterior shots in subtle subdued colors recorded in a drab winter light angelopoulos presents us with an other greece one far different from the greece of the tourist brochures with ethereal blue skies and emerald seas drowned in an eternal sunshine here the skies are covered and gray the air is cold and misty and the sands of the pristine beaches have been replaced by the trampled dirty snow of the village streets angelopoulos genius through arvanitis camera is on display throughout the filmthe suspended step of the stork is above all else a political statement aimed at the sociopolitical situation in the balkans at the end of the twentieth century it is deeply concerned with the meaning of borders and with those who are the victims of the confusion between nations in the waiting room facing the albanian border the refugees political or other outcast by the rest of humanity wait they may be stuck against a political border but unfortunately they still carry with them and hang on deeper ancestral borders those of the languages of the customs and of the races although angelopoulos political views are well known the film steers clear of any political discourse regarding the causes of the refugees plights in the process angelopoulos forces us to meditate on the concepts of geographical cultural political and personal borders angelopoulos considers himself a historian of twentieth century greece and he likes to bring lessons from the hellenic myths into his discussions in this film he does some border crossing himself between the greek and italian cultures drawing from a combined homeric and dantesque tradition of odysseus travel alexander is a telemachus in search of a story about an aging greek politicianodysseus who disappeared never to be heard of again this political man a brilliant orator unexpectedly and inexplicably left the comfort of his bourgeois existence his wife and his brilliant career to live anonymously in a refugee camp with the lowest of the low he became a poet in exile wondering how to change the world of course the politician is not alexanders father but the politician stands before alexander like a father figureodysseus as with homers telemachus alexander grows as a person during his odysseyof course it would be wrong to try and see in the film a retelling of homers odyssey in a contemporary context angelopoulos draws on odysseuss travels only as structuring and thematic elements for his film in angelopoulos ending odysseus is more like the dantes odysseus he does not leave for ithaca but goes on carrying a suitcase and alexandertelemachus is suspended between returning to his home and his career or embarking on a voyage to somewhere else he states as much in a voiceover at the beginning of the film paraphrasing few lines from dantes inferno and dont forget that the time for a voyage has come again the wind blows your eyes far away finally although angelopoulos is not a religious person there is a greek orthodox religious theme introduced during the film in the form of the yellowsuited linesmen who go around bettering things for their fellow human beings by reconnecting communications and also the christlike figure of the politician in the final scene these men in yellow demonstrate once more the byzantine iconographys influence in angelopoulos work they appear like stylites religious figures found in the orthodox tradition solitary and fervent men who took up their abode upon the tops of pillars in a form of asceticismthe film ends without a resolution as to the true identity of the character played by mastroianni angelopoulos does not give us any clues and the wifes statement its not him is far from convincing and left ambiguous enough the important question of the film is not whether he is or is not the vanished politician but that he could be the politician but the film still ends on an optimistic note whereas the wires strung from pole to pole run only along the river and thus communications across the border are still not possible and it remains impenetrable we note that this final scene is taken from a point of view across the river the camera has crossed the border and the reverse tracking shot is inviting alexander and the viewer to follow beyond the boundary on this account angelopoulos gives us hope that somehow some of the borders will eventually crumble,0,1
993,hmm is it right to compare tiffani thiessen and markpaul gosselaars post saved by the bell acting of course its not right its ridiculous and is right to give this movie a 10 rating hahahahahaha thats funny this movie wasnt so horrible though better than i expected it to be madefortv movies are often so so so similar so many of them have the same feel to them this one had that same feel but it worked even though it was yet another tortured wife whos gotta get the bstard in the end story before it started i had envisioned ms thiessen as a vixen type 90210 seductress but here she was as innocent as kelly kapowski which was refreshing eric close surprised me by playing his part really well with some decent writing the director got a pretty good convincing performance out of him without being at all cheesy all in all it was somewhat interesting definitely better than most tv movies my grade b,0,1
998,you know how star trek fans flocked to all the star trek movies even the really bad ones why to see their heroes in action one more time thats the way i feel about doc savage i am a major fanatic for the character and the prospect of seeing doc and his crew in an adventure was overwhelming and the first 20 minutes of the film only heightened that feeling of anticipation then they decided to crib elements from a number of doc adventures and throw them into this one movie resulting in a somewhat disjointed film theres a lot of promise in here diluted by a number of unfortunate choices the music the camp elements etc but the spirit of doc is there and thats what those of us familiar with doc and his crew respond to so in my longwinded way what im trying to say is that this is not a bad movie its just not as good as it should have been and anyone who is a fan of superman james bond indiana jones buckaroo banzai and many other characters ought to check this movie out just to become familiar with the hero who provided inspiration for them all,0,1
1008,170209 more 1969 dir barbet schroeder for a film that most viewers have agreed is pretty average im impressed by quite how many differing interpretations have been offered of it ive only scoured the web quite briefly and ive already been informed that more is a 19th centurystyle romance an allusion to the story of icarus a plain film full of dull people and of interest only to pink floyd completists its fair to say then that critical reception is mixed i would argue that these wildly disparate readings of barbet schroeders 1969 directorial debut are proof enough that more is anything but a pretty average filmneither is it a masterpiece of course i approached more as i did easy rider and antonionis blowup as a timecapsule film a snapshot of an era despite the differences in pace style and content between these movies they all have similar flaws either vague or downright unlikeable characters acting that seems slightly adrift from reality relaxed editing and abrupt endings that have left viewers indignant these movies never try to be persuasive or meet the audience half way they are what they are man this in itself is not a problem as long as we are left with a souvenir of the experience thankfully more offers several truly memorable images sounds and suggestions to the viewer and this is what saves itstefan is a young man who arrives in paris fresh from his studies in germany the first part of the film follows him as he falls in with a group of french hipsters accompanies them to devastatingly cool and selfconscious parties and bars before meeting estelle the two characters become sexually and romantically involved and he promises to follow her to ibiza against the advice of his friend charlie this is where the icarus thing comes into play she is the sun he is pursuing her you may now be able to guess how this all endsibiza is an idyll so far away from the bustling urgency of the overpopulated paris that the naive stefan knows he must be on to a good thing estelle remains elusive and erratic and the island has a less desirable underbelly up until now i had cared little for either of these characters and their unfocused pursuit of somewhere to be really free but once the action is pared down to just these two the film becomes poignant quite suddenly during just one single wistful exchange of dialogue in the remote villa they inhabit the place where their volatile love crystallises i went from watching with a fading optimism to being utterly enraptured i cant think of many other films that have done thisthe relationship between stefan and estelle is real and human in that we can see it go from lifedefining intimacy to disillusionment and cruel coldness they take a lot of drugs and cavort naked on the terraces the rocks and beaches their lives revolve around nothing but each other and the beautiful mediterranean surroundings for a while their situation is the very essence of freedom emotional openness and experience for its own sake but stefan is not in control and this is the downfall of more than just his future on ibizapink floyds score is a perfect fit for the exoticism the intimacy and the foreboding of more it is one of the most memorable inclusions along with the mosquito netting around estelles bed and their hallucinogenic exuberance around the windmill which appears on the soundtrack albums front cover a scene in which they take acid to escape from heroin withdrawal is illustrative of the fundamental flaws of the couple they cannot land without a crash maybe theyve come too close to what they wantedstefan never makes contact with any family or friends from before his arrival in paris we are left to presume they have no idea where he is while other 1960s counterculture movies dwell on debauchery excess the media and voyeurism schroeder has instead presented us with a story focused upon one man who backs himself into a little corner somewhere in the world and quietly disappears,0,1
1025,ok the film wasnt going to win any awards and it is pure bubblegum and it is a modern update on its a wonderful life but its just come out as a cheap release on dvd and there are a lot worse ways of blowing 13 you get a film that has a surprisingly strong cast but for most they were still a year or two from becoming b list celebs however its an enjoyable way of passing an hour and half just dont think too much in it,0,1

1039,now i love american pie 1 and 2 while 3 was great just for seann william scotts performance as stifler but after that the quality has dropped band camp kept the standard reasonably high with characters you actually cared about but naked mile was the same joke and plot lines recycled erik stiflers sex problem is like jims it had some amusing moments like the football game against the midgets and the punishment of coozeman but on the whole it lacked originality and the mile was just stupid and moronic not to mention the irritating girlfriend who doesnt want to have sex anyway enough about the naked mile i watched beta house with apprehension as i thought it could take the series to a new low but i was pleasantly surprised to be honest there is no real plot but its filled with hot girls ashley is incredible and sex jokes aplenty yes it is formulaic and the jokes are old but dwight stifler steve talley raises the bar with an exuberant performance the greek olympiad is entertaining especially the penultimate and final events while christopher mcdonalds cameo is hilarious there are weak points though coozeman is as irritating as he was in the first im still baffled to as how he ever got a part while coozeman is bad erik stifler is worse john white made naked mile a pain to watch but in beta house he takes his performance to a whole new low first and foremost he lacks charisma a stifler prerequisite you really cant care less about him the only reason i was bothered about his relationship was so ashley could be on screen she shines above him as does the rest of the cast seriously john white is the ultimate in bad acting and has about as much charisma as a dead fish saying that the film does entertain and coozemans fear that his girl is not exactly a girl is brilliantly funny overall this film is worth renting get a few of your mates in and have a laugh at the vomitfest event and vent your anger at erik loser stifler,0,1

1105,the first installment of this notorious horror series is presented as if it were a snuff film discovered by the producers and set up like an amateur camcorder tape complete with a digital timer at the bottom of the frame it presents a woman being kidnapped by a gang of blackclad men who torture her for several days before finally killing her the hapless victim is beaten savagely and pelted with raw meat before having her fingernails pulled out with pliers her hand smashed with a hammer her eye punctured with a needle and so forthin the most nauseating scene the womans captors burn her with hot water and drop live maggots into the burns the series received a great deal of publicity when american actor charlie sheen believing the series to contain actual murder attempted to ban its distribution in the united states an fbi investigation revealed that the films were only what they appeared to be to most viewers sick recreations using nasty but obvious special effects gruesomely staged by acclaimed japanese comicbook artist hideshi hino who also directed the third and fourth episodes this film is a sure way to clear all but the most tolerant of rooms but gorehounds probably wont find anything special,0,1

1125,at the beginning of the film we watch may and toots preparing for their trip to london for a visit to their grown children one can see toots is not in the best of health but he goes along when he dies suddenly mays world begins to spin out of controlthe film directed by roger michell based on a screen play by hanif kureshi is a study of how this mother figure comes to terms with her new status in life and her awakening into a world that she doesnt even know it existed until nowmays life as a suburban wife was probably boring obviously her sexual life was next to nothing we get to know shes had a short extra marital affair then nothing at all when may loses her husband she cant go back home so instead she stays behind minding her grandson at her daughters home it is in this setting that may begins lusting after young and hunky darren her daughters occasional loverdarren awakes in may a passion she has not ever known may responds by transforming herself in front of our eyes may who at the beginning of the film is dowdy suddenly starts dressing up becoming an interesting and attractive woman she ends up falling heads over heels with this young man that keeps her sated with a passion she never felt beforehaving known a couple of cases similar to this story it came as no surprise to me to watch mays reaction her own chance of a normal relationship with bruce a widower ends up frustratingly for may who realizes how great her sex is with darren the younger man we figure is only into this affair to satisfy himself and for a possibility of extorting money from may finally the daughter helen discovers what mum has been doing behind her back when she discovers the erotic paintings her mother has madethe film is a triumph for the director in anne reid mr michell has found an extraordinary actress who brings so much to the role of may also amazing is daniel craig he knows how darren will react to the situation anna wilson jones as helen is also vital to the story as she is the one that has to confront the mother about what has been going on behind her back oliver ford davies plays a small part as bruce the older man in helens class and is quite effectivethe film is rewarding for those that will see it with an open mind,0,1
1146,i must admit i liked this movie and didnt find it all misogynist it could be subtitled three ways of looking at liv tyler three different men become obsessed with the same womanand tell their stories to very different charactersone manjohn goodman tells his story to a priestthe very funny richard jenkinsfor goodmans charcter the liv tyler character is an idealized saint the second coming of his sainted wifetheresafor paul riesers characterwho tellls story to a shrinka fine understated performance by the great reba mcintirethe liv tyler character is simplyan object of kinkysexual fantasyfinally matt dillons rather dimwitted charcter tells his side of the story to a sleazy hit man played by micheal douglasall three of these narratives of obsession are told simultaneouslyand all are amusing finaly the film ends in a bizarrely funny climax that i wont give away,0,1
1148,crazy scottish warrior race stranded deep in outerspace low on food and budget free started ten now down to three who will help these men of pluck with visual effects that semi suck but i kinda liked the freaky being if i met one then id be fleeing but not if i had scottish mates wed fn swear and avoid that fate so in the end it wasnt botched it was a dvd im glad i watched but if they ever make a sequel dump some actors not all were equal some were good with gritty acting some were wooden and should maybe pack it in but the action kept me watching all the shooting shouting didnt stall ill tell my friends not to fear and watch again in another year,0,1
1158,this is my favorite of the three care bears movies once again i liked all the songs the big problem however as most people have pointed out was that this story contradicts the original for those that saw the first movie recall the bears met their cousins who they apparently never knew about it wasnt of course until the end that the cousins received their tummy symbols after proving how much they cared in this story however the cousins grow up with the care bears and have tummy symbols all along that being said this isnt a bad movie as long you keep it separate from the first i thought the darkheart character much more evil then the nicholas of the first but at the same time i felt it added a sort of balance to the sweetness of the care bears i also liked the we care part at the end although i know other people had mixed feelings about that scene and of course i loved the songs my favorites being growing up and forever young the care bears movies have always had such good songs ten stars for a very good movie,0,1
1201,i hate reading reviews that say something like dont waste your time this film stinks on ice it does to that reviewer yet for me it may have some sort of nave charm if you like the other whistler series films this one will be watchable if you like 40s noirish films this one will be watchablethis film is not as good in my opinion as any of the earlier series entries which starred richard dix as the protagonist its much slower and the plot is trite youve seen this same narrative device used in many other films and usually betterbut the acting is good and so is the lighting and the dialog its just lacking in energy and youll likely figure out exactly whats going on and how its all going to come out in the end not more than a quarter of the way throughthe whistler series is seminoir and there character mood lighting camera movement and angles are more important than the story itself but this film is not noir its too light weight and hollywood innocent for that neither richard dixs character nor those of any of his ladies in the previous films had to come to a good end you just never knew until the endbut still ill recommend this one for at least a single viewing ive watched it at least twice myself and got a reasonable amount of enjoyment out of it both times,0,1
1203,although this film is somewhat filled with eighties cheese i have a place for it in my dvd rack and i dont know why i think i like it because the moral of the story is television is garbage so turn it off and go and get a life for those of you who do decide to heed the message then you should try reading the book its nothing like the film at all to ruin it for you at the end of the story a fatally wounded richards ends up crashing a plane into the network building killing himself everyone inside and shutting down the network at the same time i read it many years ago but today it would hard not to compare it to 911,0,1
1219,ive never seen a bollywood film before but i caught the first ten minutes of this laughed myself silly and hit the r button on sky im glad i did i hope i dont insult anybody because basically the bf and i loved it but we couldnt take it half as seriously as the actors did especially the obsessed one who i understand is a huge bollywood star because weve seen him on the cover of lots of dvds since and i even saw a doll of him today in hamleys the bf keeps on about this bloke i am beginning to think hes obsessed he keeps saying that its strange for the traditionally good looking one to be the antihero of a film but then we do like films that arent your stock predictable hollywood fareit was completely over the top but really good fun if all bollywood films are like this then were watching more i have had that bloomin song in my head all week and i cant speak a word of hindi ps any recommendations would be appreciated,0,1
1229,kurosawa fresh into color losses sight of his usual themes of truth and perception of reality and opts for a depressing take on tokyos slums kurosawa stretches for a style that was in my opinion his antithesis that is to say i feel as if kurosawa wanted to make an ozu picture poorly paced poorly conceived this movie is a rare dud in this auteur body of excellent work while ikiru while being mundane and depressing was still interesting and well paced and while stray dog depicted the slums and social poverty of japan without being too heavy handed or boring do desu ka den has all the somberness that one could expect with its content with none of the redeeming qualities of earlier kurosawa picturesbe warned this is not a movie that kurosawa should be judged by,0,1
1252,a heap of human flesh lies asleep on a red pillow this is the hunk of naked meat that is little joe a new york hustler who lives with his bisexual wife and baby child the film follows a day in his life after hes woken from sleep by his wife demanding that he go out and do the traditional male thing be a breadwinner but the use she wants to put the bread to is to pay for her new girlfriends abortion we certainly arent in the traditional family unit hereafter playing with his child joe hits the streets to cruise for johns the clients come thick and fast the ordinary gay man who wants to meet him again because they work well together the old english classical scholar who pays 100 to see joe pose like an ancient greek athlete the female topless dancer who blows joe then boasts about being raped the ageing gym bunny who doesnt think that what he and joe do together is queer after a hard days work joe returns home exhausted only to be put down by his wife and the girlfriend he goes back to sleep as they harp and undermine himflesh is fascinating as it takes what is a traditional classical mainstream structure it has an inciting incident the money for the abortion and setup a confrontation and a resolution albeit a very downbeat one even a protagonist with a strongly motivated goal and then proceeds to concentrate on the details of the day to day routine of these people who are perfectly ordinary to themselves but extraordinary to most mainstream people it all seems very authentic and natural its hard to see the acting the actors are so fully being their roles but yet the whole thing is a piece of cunning artifice a beautifully drawn portrait or an intricately carved statue director morrissey carefully plants every incident every encounter around his theme of human flesh become packaged commodity but with such cunning slight of hand that you almost dont notice him doing it the wife packages joes sexual organ the old englishmen laments a long gone order of classical beauty which created art and poetry from human fleshly beauty the transvestite friends of the stripper package themselves as women whilst reading a hollywood magazine in which real women are packaged as products the gym bunny buys joes friendship and affection thinks artificial porn is real and cant tell as we cant that joe is performing his friendship and intimacy for the cash the film itself presents itself as the ne plus ultra of cinematic realism but what we might as well be dealing with here is fine art or an early example of concept artthe genius a word not lightly used of morrissey was to find a way of taking warhols arty pretensions to filmmaking which were interesting sure but boring as hell and making them into saleable products which remain amongst the most intriguing works of cinema art ever made commercial cans labelled flesh and trash and heat with a product label andy warhol which sells an idea about the product as much as the product itself yet just as you reel from morrisseys cynicism you are spellbound by his ability to still maintain the highest of standards and depth of meaning the constant what seem like camera flashes continually draw attention to the filmic nature of what one is witnessing yet you get drawn into the illusion all the same flesh is surely one of the most extraordinary pieces of cinema magic to ever spellbind an audience,0,1
1253,this movie is about basically human relations and the interaction between them the main character is an old lady who at the twilight of her life starts a journey to her past doing an analysis of how she lived her life this journey is precipitated because of the sons economic crisis and his intentions to put her in a nursing home it is a very honest look to some issues that we all ask ourselves at some point in life and there is plenty of secondary ideas to discuss in this movie such as family legacy real love marriage or destiny although this type of movie melodramas are nothing new this one can be useful to watch it with family members to discuss some ideas there is a good performance by the actors and the characters are very believable but because of the time some characters are maybe not fully developed i really recommend this movie for a quiet saturday afternoon,0,1
1255,may i never have to go to this hospital or hospice if i want to be politically correct which ass coined this asinine phrase anyway for anything other than directions on how to get out of town george c did a masterful job playing the burned out over worked cynic who has come to the conclusion that his life has been a waste but is helpless to change his environment or conditions even when given a golden opportunity which probably wasnt so golden anyway i got several laughs out of this brutally black comedy however at the same time was sobered and often chilled to the marrow because i fear this very atmosphere pervades most houses of healing even as i write,0,1
1258,a big surprise probably because i was expecting it to suck the reviews were pretty dismissive of it even though they all seemed to agree that the concept was golden a man finds out his new girlfriend is a super hero and finds when he wants to break up with her that shes kind of a psycho i kept expecting it to fall apart but it never really did sure it doesnt make as much of its awesome premise as it could and chooses to be short when it might have been better to expand the films universe but i cant blame it for that uma thurman is great as the bipolar superhero ggirl and ive discovered after several years of disliking him that luke wilson can be absolutely perfect when cast as a schlub hes given two of the best comic performances of 2006 the other in the pretty much unreleased idiocracy i absolutely cracked up at the expressions on his face when he and thurman first have sex its one of the funniest sex scenes ever my only real complaint is that they make ggirl a bit too much of a psycho like almost unbelievably so maybe with some background i could have accepted it better i can forgive its flaws though because i had a really good time watching it underrated for sure,0,1
1261,sudden impact tends to be treated as eastwoods artistic failure at a point in his career when he had established a good reputation as a director the reason is actually not the film itself but the attitude it takes towards vigilantism which it seems to support in some places it actually owes more to death wish than the original dirty harry film one might argue if that is so at the end of the day its a film about guilt justice and retribution for me at the end of the day its more empathy than sympathy however in view of all these arguments it is easily overlooked that sudden impact is an awfully well made film forget the go ahead punk make my day scene thats iconic but not original but look at the views of san fransisco taken from the air zooming in on the city the first 15 or 20 minutes are quite spectacular or have a look at the brilliantly made scene where sondra lockes character visits her mentally ill sister in hospital eastwood makes great use of the juxtaposition of faces so all in all sudden impact is a very visual film that really shows how mature eastwood is as a director and if i remember correctly it was actually the first time eastwood put that on screen albeit in an action film of debatable ideology also i think this is the first well paced film eastwood directed although eastwood has enormous talent as a director dramaturgy has always been his weak point see play misty for me breezy etc thepace of the narrative leads to the visual elements being well integrated into the film and not distracting from the story the only thing that is really annoying is the farting dog,0,1
1301,i think that anybody whose dumb enough to risk being a wax dummy just so they can go to a football game or they dont want to leave their car to get stripped deserves whatever happens to themthe guy wade who went to a barbershop and asked for the heman haircut wasnt my type but theres this really cute scene of him having his eyebrows and facial hair waxed thats a little too highmaintenance for me also fun but not my type is the fat guy in the big sunglasses who looks like elton john only gayer but that whole plot goes nowhere blake was hoti could see myself with him if he wasnt so into his girlfriend who is a phony paris hilton in a bad wig no chihuahaua in her handbagthough but that would have been really precious i dont think girls who look like that go to football games anyways nick the car thief is the sexiest one of the best parts is where a football lands by him and instead of throwing it back he chucks his cigarette down and it burns the football see thats just the kind of guy he is he has a sister who looks dumb borrowing his white wifebeater her bra straps are showing for like 12 the moviemostly you will just want to wax your legs and not ever go to football games after seeing this,0,1
1318,ok so the musical pieces were poorly written and generally poorly sung though walken and marner particularly walken sounded pretty good and so they shattered the fourth wall at the end by having the king and his nobles sing about the battle with the ogre and praise the efforts of puss in boots when they by rights shouldnt have even known about itwho cares its christopher freakin walken doing a movie based on a fairy tale and he sings and dances his acting style fits the role very well as the devious mischievous puss who seems to get his master into deeper and deeper trouble but in fact has a plan hes thought about seven or eight moves in advance and if youve ever seen walken in any of his villainous roles you know the ogre bit the dust hard at the end when walken got him into his trapa fun film and a mustsee for anyone who enjoys the unique style of christopher walken,0,1
1328,hi i am john and i would like to tell you all that my dog was in this film at the baiting screen he was the pit like one that was going to bite the man chained up my dogs name was colin and he stayed away filming for a week for this film he was also in other things like crime watch uk and some other small parts he won some dog shows but he has passed away now i miss him he was a great true and loyal dog and we had some great times together but he got cancer which could not be treated so i had to get him put down that was the worst day of my life i hope this gives you some thing to look for in the film if you watch it againthanks all,0,1
1338,i admit creating great expectations before watching because some friends mentioned it and they are not pervs as a must see and it is a must see just dont expect to see something outbreakingthe freudian psychoanalyzes are interesting in many parts of the film but theres just too much perversion and it doesnt stick in the endsome of the good things are the analyzes of kieslowskis blue most of david lynchs some of hitchcocks and perhaps a couple more i missed i just remembereddogville and i usually dont miss things unless they are too obvious or loose in the airother than being repetitive which makes it too long the documentary is enjoyable in the sense of noticing some perversions fed by our unconscious hence the commercial success of most thrillers studied and used as basis for this theoryi really enjoyed the energetic tone of the narration and the effort of mr zizek to revive freuds theory which has been numb for too long specially in north america again its way over the top and i believe not to be a completely waste of time for i do believe most humans have a dark appreciation for death and blood,0,1
1362,now i have read some negative reviews for this show on this website and quite frankly im appalled for anyone to even think that the sopranos is not television then im afraid i dont know what the world has come to let me tell u something i started watching many tv shows like lost prison break dexter deadwood and even invasion but all of those shows lost their touch after the first season especially lost and prison break which i refuse to watch because the companies took 2 genius ideas and butchered them by making more than one season then we have the sopranos i can honestly say that this is the only television series that i have ever watched where i have been enthralled in all of its season and more importantly all of its episodes there is no department that this show doesnt excel in acting nothing short of superb james gandolfini is one of my favourite actors and i feel that his acting is absolutely stunning in every episode after i heard that hbo wanted ray liotta to play tony i felt that it wouldve been the better choice however after watching the first few episodes i knew that hbo had done a great job in casting james as tony the raw emotion he displays is superb then we have everyone else edie falco michael imperioli lorraine bracco dominic chianese whom i remembered as johnny ola in the godfather part 2 and my personal two favourite characters tony sirico and steve van zandt paulie walnuts gualtieri and silvio dante all of these actors perform to the best quality and all giving an excellent performance in each episode then we have the story never have i been so sucked into a tv show before the story is nothing short of excellent each episode is directed superbly and the score of this show is just fantastic i feel that the sopranos is one show that i can watch again and again and never get bored of its got everything from hilarious humour to brutal violence but nonetheless it is and will always be the best thing to ever grace the television and i challenge anyone to find a real flaw in the show not just say its too violent or they feel that the character of tony is immoral i mean it is a mafia show at the end of the day i dont think that the characters are going to be very honest or loyal to god i implore everyone to watch this show because believe me youll be hooked from the very first episode i was and i have even gotten a few friends who had firstly refused to watch the show hooked on it trust me when i say that this show is a godsend compared to the crap that comes on tv after youve watched the first season youll inevitably agree with me when i once again say that this show dominates television and no tv show current or future will ever upstage the marvel that is the sopranos,0,1
1365,if you are under 13 or above 13 and pretty intoxicated youll enjoy dwar if you are a seriously dedicated fan of all kinds of brainless action films youll enjoy dwar otherwise dont bother i saw the movie today with my nephews and 3 of their friends they really loved it and that made me feel good after the movie was over all the kidsmy nephews and their friendscould not stop thanking me for taking them to the theaterthe cg is good acting and directing are horrible storyline is extremely simple but since the half of the audience was kids they were screaming shouting and cheering every time the dragons appeared on the screen this made the viewing experience far more exciting than it should have beenits a good movie to take your kids to but except for the final battle sequence dwar is disappointing i give this film 7 out of 10 mainly because the kids loved it so much,0,1
1369,it follows blockheads and a chump at oxford two films that are hard to top not that saps at sea is a bad film it is the last good comedy unless one insists on jitterbugs or another of the later films that laurel hardy made its just that it is a tossoff little film without the crazy destructive crescendo of blockheads or the astounding sight of stans real personality in a chump at oxford to revel in at 57 minutes it is shorter than the other two films a bit but that actually is not a bad point for it it has just enough time to it to hit the right notes its just not as special as the other twostan and ollie work in a factory that manufactures horns i suspect that there was a bit of chaplin influence in this sequence one recalls a similar assemblyline incident in modern times only four years earlier ollies nerves finally snap and he goes on a rampage he goes home and naturally his roommate stan does not help stan has a music lesson with an eccentric professor on his instrument youve got it a trombone after beating up the poor professor ollie has problems with the incompetent janitorengineer ben turpin in a nice brief appearance and then faces his doctor jimmy finleyson and his nerve tester a balloon that inflates as you push air out of ollies stomach finleyson announces that it is a bad case of horniphobia and ollie needs a vacation with plenty of quiet and goats milk they end up going to a ship but ollie and stan know nothing about seamanship so they plan to sleep on the ship unfortunately the goat gnaws the rope until it breaks and the ship sails off also unfortunately on board is richard cramer an escaped dangerous criminal this is not going to be a peaceful vacationsaps at sea like a chump could have been three shorts one at the factory one at the apartment and one on the boat each would have been a successful short and they all make a funny film but the stitching of the parts together shows there are some very amusing moments in the film the discoveries of how turpins ineptitude causes various mishaps with water taps and stoves in the apartment the accidental remarks of building manager charlie hall when stan or ollie runs by him and asks for directions can you help me find the basement asks stan certainlyyou cant miss it its downstairs says hall who realizes what a stupid comment he just made and cramers mistreatment of his two hostage slaves he calls ollie dizzy and stan daffy an allusion to the dean brothers of the st louis cardinal teams of the 1930s see dan daileys the pride of st louis cramer has the boys cook him up some food and they make a synthetic meal boot laces for spaghetti for instance to get him sick to be overpowered when he realizes what they have done he forces them to eat the meal themselves their reactions are brilliantsaps at sea is not on par with the top line of laurel hardy films but it is a good film on the whole and a good conclusion to the best years of their film career 1927 1940 when they were with hal roach in the immediate couple of years before it appeared the boys and roach had serious problems involving production costs our relations where stan was producer on the film artistic problems scenes from swiss miss were cut meaninglessly and contractual arguments leading to ollie appearing with harry langdon in zenobia stan and ollie hit back with the flying deuces wherein the production was not roachs but boris morros at last a two picture deal of a chump at oxford and saps at sea concluded the arguments and problems and on a high note the boys left roach unfortunately they never found any subsequent film relationship with a producer as satisfactory as this had been,0,1

1441,what can i say about this film that wont give you any preconceived notions when you see it very little the plot has to do with the return from hospital of a teenage girl after she broke down what follows after that is the movie it is one of the creepiest most mind blowing films of the past several years everything about the film is just slightly off center and leaves you feeling ill at ease well after the film has ended it is not a perfect film the film has problems in its final half hour which make an already confusing story even more confusedif youve read any number of other comments here on imdb and elsewhere youll know that a great deal of time has been spent trying to unlock what actually is going on im not sure what i actually think of this film beyond the fact that it scared me and disturbed me in ways that most well known horror films ever have if you like horror and dont mind not having everything clearly summed up i suggest you try this since it will more than likely make your skin crawl,0,1

1512,i was geared up to not like this movie and the first 10 minutes or so did nothing to allay my fears it starts off with 2 high school gangs squaring off against each other with bad kungfu a scenario found in countless other korean films hohum add the fact that the story was written by the same guy who wrote he was cool which was barely passable and well i thought i was in for a nondescript 2 hoursbut dont give up so quickly a romance of their own was directed by taegyun kim who also did volcano high which i thought was loads of fun anyway romance of their own soon takes a turn much for the better a high school girl just having moved to seoul finds herself in the middle of attention from two prospective suitors each guy has his own merit and it is not clear which one if either would be the right pickwhat follows is not your usual teen love triangle the emotions are complex and while you may not agree with certain choices or actions as the film develops you can certainly understand why the characters make themthe movie asks questions of the characters and the audience who does one choose at what point is one obligated to even make a choice and is it unfair to one if it seems he is being strung along after you or your heart has made a choice how do you react and how should you react when new information comes up that sheds new light on the situation there is one scene near the end that is very subtle but perfectly captures what i think would be a reallife reaction instead of overthetop movie reaction the subtlety is in a character in the background of the scene recent events and revelations have left him confused and emotionally overwhelmed basically he doesnt know what to make of things instead of having him act out something or look all gapemouthed dumbstruck he just stares off at some fixed point unable to react or say anything at all its like someone just pulled the plug on him his reaction rang true to me and i appreciated the scenelike most korean films there is a mix of action bravado slapstick and melodrama korean films often take abrupt turns see sex is zero for a great example which can be quite a shock for the uninitiated go ahead and initiate yourself with this one like it love it or hate it i think most viewers will be able to relate to and appreciate the characters actions and reactions,0,1

1555,hey now i cant claim to have seen all of the films of jesse jesus franco and there sure seem to be a lot of them but this is one of the better and weirder of the lot that i have seen id say most likely he was in his prime back in the late sixtiesearly seventies and anything lately has been a bit too strange for me and it takes a lot for me to declare that anyway this is like one big bad dream where parts of it seem to come true at various points this woman is an actress or something performs in some theater in berlin where acts of fake torture are performed for an appreciative audience and she seems to have this problem with dreaming the catch to whats real and whats not in this movie is apparently the real stuff is in sharp focus and the dream stuff isnt she seems to exist in a state of deja vu i wont say this makes a whole lot of sense but it is pretty wild and weird and entertaining shots of berlin make it seem like a lonely and creepy place so that adds to the atmosphere the ending is extremely abrupt though the film just ends and the tape went black i guess no need to let you know it was over at that point my copy was from the anchor bay eurotrash collection and i say give me more eurotrash i cant get enough of that crap but its good crap,0,1
1567,imagine that dragnet episode where friday and gannon go into a typical 1970 den of hippie inequity but instead of giving everyone a lecture they get some thats joe in a nutshellthis film of a workingclass bigot and a rich guy whos just killed his girlfriends drugdealer boyfriend has dated terribly and most of the supporting acting is stilted but its still interesting to watch peter boyle then about 35 plays joe the bigot and he looks like james gandolfini in her film debut susan sarandon plays the doeeyed daughter and while she doesnt necessarily hint at her future greatness you cant take your eyes off her,0,1

1609,i saw this movie recently 2 hours later my head still hurt from laughing the plot was soo awful the jokes were soo bad but what i didnt count on were1 the 2 scenes before and after the movie that had pat and jay posing that caused more than enough laughter2 the kick through the windshield that decapitated the evildoerthis movie is about 20 times better than the rush hour series and my copy even came with a disclamer saying if you didnt like the movie send certificate to hbo while i considered it the date you had to send it in was january 1991 which also caused wackiness to ensue,0,1
1626,i was surprised once more my darling had not generated enough votes at this writing for a user rating its a screwy comedy i have enjoyed many times over the years robert montgomerys mission places him in some very improbable situations and hes just the man for the job he maintains his trademark befuddled look throughout the film and hysterically too ann blyth plays his precociouseccentric pursuer who assumes a relationship that does not exist her character is kooky enough to warrant the unearned nickname killer but remains cute and cuddlyamong the glut of b movies from the late 1940s and 1950s once more my darling is a standout this one is worth looking for,0,1
1628,when i was young i had seen very few movies my parents in all their wisdom rented this one i was very wary of what the movie was about in fact i wasnt even allowed to watch it my brother and sister got to of course and this made me very angry so what did i do late at night i trashed the vcr kicked the screen of the tv in and called the police and reported vandals i was arrested of course i was unable to get my foot out of the tv set before the police arrived i was only given a stern talking to and sent home my parents grounded me of course and made me work to repay the debt for the tv and vcr this tore me apart slave labour really sucks believe me but i had to do it chores all around the house what happened in the end we got a big screen tv dvd player and a surround sound system for my work how did i get the money easy i made movies of my own and sold them to disney do you remember finding neno well i wrote that movie and filmed my goldfish in their fish tanks they rewrote the plot of course and did it in cgi because they couldnt afford to make it a real life action picture like i had done in the end i never saw the film the head that didnt die and the rating i gave it is my life rating its doing pretty good,0,1
1639,the details in the big trail were so incredible that i felt that the movie was made at the time it represents i have never seen wagons that were so real they were big loaded with accessories and even felt as though they had been filled with details under the canvas covers that was never meant to be seen every speck of dirt every scratch every splinter was there modern day computer technology could never recreate the scenes of the numerous wagons as they move across the land or circle to fend off indians the wagons were all real individual vehicles each with its own real team of horses or oxenthe actors clothing could not have felt more genuine with the exception of john waynes buckskin outfit and marguerite churchills nice dress the clothes were very common looking tattered or dirty in an authentic looking way many of the actors and actresses were born before electricity and indoor plumbing were common and they must have felt comfortable with the surroundings all the indians were real indians rather than white extras painted tanwomen of the old west had to be sturdy because there was a lot of work in every scene showing work done by the people of the wagon train women are shown chopping wood hauling logs etc this realism was so natural looking that it did not come across as a statement on the role of women of the day rather than a fact of survivalthe plot of revenge and romance is played well nothing is overstated or overplayedsomething was lost along the way in the 1930s in hollywood as much as i love the fake scenery and controlled environment of old movies the big trail manages to feel real above all else the more i see big budget movies of the silent era the more i like them i can think of few movies of the 1930s that i have seen that equal the grandeur of the best of the 1920s if there were home movies made in the days of wagon trains the big trail is what they would look like,0,1
1670,after a brief prologue showing a masked man stalking and then slashing the throat of an older gentleman on a deserted urban turn of the century australian street we meet julie rebecca gibney and peter john adam as they go out house hunting they manage to get a loan for a fixerupper on a posh sydney street but it turns out that physical disrepair is not the only problem with their new home it just may be haunted13 gantry row combines a memorable if somewhat clichd story with good to average direction by catherine millar into a slightly above average shockerthe biggest flaws seem partially due to budget but not wholly excusable to that hurdle a crucial problem occurs at the beginning of the film the opening thriller scene features some wonky editing freeze frames and series of stills are used to cover up the fact that theres not much action suspense should be created from staging not fancy fix it in the mix techniques there is great atmosphere in the scene from the location the lighting the fog and such but the camera should be slowly following the killer and the victim cutting back and forth from one to the other as we track down the street showing their increasing proximity the tracking and the cuts need to be slow the attack needed to be longer clearer and better blocked as it stands the scene has a strong made for television feel and a low budget one at thatafter this scene we move to the present and the flow of the film greatly improves the story has a lot of similarities to the amityville horror 1979 though the budget forces a much subtler approach millar and scriptwriter tony morphett effectively create a lot of slyly creepy scenarios often dramatic in nature instead of special effectsoriented such as the mysterious man who arrives to take away the old slabs of iron which had been bizarrely affixed to an interior wallfor some horror fans the first section of the film might be a little heavy on realist drama at least the first half hour of the film is primarily about julie and peter trying to arrange financing for the house and then trying to settle in but morphett writes fine intelligent dialogue the material is done well enough that its often as suspenseful as the more traditional thriller aspects that arise laterespecially if youve gone through similar travails while trying to buy your own houseonce they get settled and things begin to get weirder even though the special effects often leave much to be desired the ideas are good the performances help create tension there isnt an abundance of death and destruction in the filmtheres more of an abundance of home repair nightmares but neither menace is really the pointthe point is human relationships there are a number of character arcs that are very interesting the house exists more as a metaphor and a catalyst for stress in a romantic relationship that can make it go sour and possibly destroy it that its in a posh neighborhood and that the relationship is between two successful yuppies shows that these problems do not only afflict those who can place blame with some external woe such as money or health problems peters character evolves from a striving corporate employee with normal workbased friendships to someone with more desperation as he becomes subversive scheming to attain something more liberating and meaningful at the same time we learn just how shallow those professional friendships can be julie goes through an almost literal nervous breakdown but finally finds liberation when she liberates herself from her failing romantic relationshipalthough 13 gantry row never quite transcends its madefortelevision clunkiness as a tv movie this is a pretty good one with admirable ambitions anyone fond of haunted house films psycho films or horrorthrillers with a bit more metaphorical depth should find plenty to enjoy it certainly isnt worth spending 30 for a dvd that was the price my local pbs station was asking for a copy of the film after they showed it factoring in shipping and handling but its worth a rental and its definitely worth watching for free,0,1
1698,a young woman comes to the home town of his husband after he passed away in an accident she barely settles down in this small town but shortly after loses her little son in a kidnapping and all her hopes this could lead to all kinds following plots in a normal movie find a new partner and being happy finally or depressed enough to struggle and finally kill herself she does try to kill herself but not after a series of severe fights with god she trusts in god only to find that god seems to forgive everyone even the killer well i should be careful here about god the movie doesnt mean a thing against god the way the movie deals the issue is quite interesting not in the womans point of view or from gods perspective in this way there would be lots of grass growing clouds flying views i suppose rather its from a third partys eye the movie let us to perceive and doesnt explain a thingthe movie wouldnt be so interesting were there only the woman theres this man whos everywhere around the woman and obviously in love with her but in his own way hes a funny guy like a clown i should say who shamelessly hangs around our heroine the combination of these two the woman full of tension crying and throwing up always and the man smiling and talking stupidly ends up in a good balance of emotions nothing absurdly wrong or too tedioushighly recommend,0,1
1719,in the veins of jeepers creepers and the texas chainsaw massacre monster man surprisingly wellmadethough mindlesslittle horror throw in a little buddycomedy nice gore and intense scare its hard no to say that monster man is really entertaining the low budget seem pretty obvious but it doesnt effected the presentation of the movie in general and put more big budget horror movies in shameyes the plot somewhat generic as possible pair of friend adam eric jungmanand harley justin urich are driving cross country to interrupt the wedding of a woman adam has always loved while adam is more nerdy type harley is a selfproclaimed ladies man and very offensive loudmouth adding a bonus to the plot then they picked up a sexy hitchhiker sarah aimee brooks things turn into nightmare when a monster truck with scary face drive stalking them when dead body starts counting they must do the race against the time before their own life on riskthe plot is obviously reminiscent of many prior famous horror movies but michael davis as the writer and director succeed in keeping the tension the scare is build well enough where characterization is never be the best but fairly okay the script also littered with comedies that works for the funny moments and they quite enjoyable rather than annoying and also wait for the twist in the finale its hilarious and shocking in the same time which is pretty amusingas conclusion monster man surprisingly entertaining it deserves more attention in the big screen it proves that big budget doesnt make an effective horror movie but skill does something that the director has shown and delivers,0,1

1981,maria braun is an extraordinary woman presented fully and very credibly despite being so obtuse as to border on implausibility she will do everything to make her marriage work including shameless opportunism and sexual manipulation and thus beneath the vicey exterior she reveals a rather sweet value system the film suffers from an abrupt and unexpected ending which afterwards feels wholly inadequate with the convenience familiar from ending your school creative writing exercise with and then i woke up it is also bookended at the other end with the most eccentric title sequence ive ever seen but dont let any of that put you off,0,1

1986,most critics seem to have dismissed this film like so many other charles bronson vehicles as just another patchwork of mindless violence and while there is a fair amount of mayhem death wish 3 is not that awful of an effort particularly for fans of the series and its starthis time out aging charlies paul kersey is let loose by a police chief desperate to clean up a rough part of new york city the triggerhappy vigilante moves into the heart of gang territory where he once again becomes a oneman army in an urban war of good versus evil bronson at least the older version is truly at his bestim not saying death wish 3 is a classic indeed to the discriminating eye it has a plethora of imperfections the characters are generally made of cardboard the violence is over the top a man well into his 60s outruns and outspooks dozens of young punks but in the tradition of the original death wish and later films such as falling down with michael douglas it has a definite crowdpleasing charm who doesnt want to see gangbangers get their due there are also some great cheesy moments and oneliners so common in 1980s films when a tenant of his apartment building sees kersey setting up a booby trap for instance the vigilante lightheartedly says hes thinning the herd a line only bronson can truly make workso you see the key to enjoying death wish 3 is to accept it for what it is it aint spielberg and it aint art so throw the popcorn in the microwave and have fun with it,0,1

2029,i couldnt help but relish the entire premise of cat in the brain because it dutifully explains a directors steadily going mad seeing people murdered from past movies he has made even mundane activities such as cooking a meal in the microwave or running a faucet of water yield some horrific butchery from a film in the past director fulci playing himself is directing ghosts of sodomand can not seem to deprive his mental well being from constant murder he seeks help from a psychiatrist who instead uses fulcis work as a method to execute a series of innocent people hypnotizing the director into thinking that perhaps hes responsiblethis is obviously a film playfully poking fun at fulcis image while exploring the themes of how such a profession which produces so much death and destruction rarely untamed could mold and shape a legacy the film features pretty much a wraparound story surrounding nonstop graphic violence with every possible way to kill a woman expressed in grisly detail this has a shower murder hitchcock never could direct or probably want to the films savagery compliments the mental state of fulcis fulcii knowduring the running time reality and cinematic fiction have fused and fulci can find no escape the endingexplaining the old clichits only a moviecouldnt work any better than it does here fulcis boat says perversionexcellent touchand he sails offi can only wish this was his final film because thats a perfect close if there ever was one david l thompson is the deranged psychiatrist planning to kill his adulterous wife jeoffrey kennedy is a cop fulci fears had a family murdered by the fiendthe ultraviolence in the film features plenty of unique ways to take a head off such as the door to a chest a scythe a chainsaw and hatchet the most brutal violence derives from nasty chainsaw activity as a dead body is hacked to pieceshow a gardeners chainsaw work on a log fits beautifully in one nightmarish hallucination sequencethe most shocking use of a chainsaw is when a little boy gets decapitated the opening scene with the puppet cat tearing away feasting on fulcis brain is a howler the scenes which are spliced within the film featuring a horrified fulci looking on are obvious but i couldnt help but enjoy this anyway,0,1
2057,standard rise to fame tale that has a few high points number one lonette mckee as sister who gives a stunning star making performance the fact that she never became a huge sensation after this is beyond me sadly she is a supporting character and we are forced to focus on irena carters bland character sparkle whose rise to fame is easy boring and unconvincing however whenever the girls go on stage and perform the movie comes back to life the original music by curis mayfield must be praised the copy i saw was a very old vhs tape the picture quality was pretty low as well as the production values im guessing all in all its worth a gander,0,1

2092,heres another antonioni that will be rediscovered again and again as soon as it comes out on tape or dvd i saw it a few months ago when it ran for the first time even in metropolitan movie capital lafor a couple of weeks and then disappeared art house audiences seem to have opted for their own special territory where older favorites like antonioni and resnais are only welcome as occasional curiositiesat first i was disappointed thought the pace to be unbearably boring and that the man had lost a chance for years antonioni had found it difficult to find financingat an advanced age to add another masterpiece to his canon but knowing antonioni for what he was and how i had at first reacted to blowup and the passenger i refused to pass judgment until i had seen the film again i went back the next day and i should not have been surprised that the film kept pulling me in making me aware of things i had thought about and lost track of throughout my life driving home in a contemporary setting points exposed for the first time some forty years ago in laventurra forming an environment of subtle moods so characteristcally and fascinatingly alienated in tone and quite comedic actually that i couldnt get enough the scene with malkovich sitting on the fancy colored swings on the windswept beach with the weather so beautifully silver skied and the enou2 track in the background flowing through at just its rhythm had been my favorite it still was but now the whole film was just as great what a strange phenomenon the complex simplicity or the invisible complex which antonionis eye alone seems to be able to pick up and communicate the odd thing is though it does look at first glance like a softcore porno of some kind and it does feature plenty of sex and the maddeningly gorgeous sophie marceau and plently of other international stars to distract you this film is unmistakably antonionis to its core but you will not sense to what a profound extent until you have seen it a few times and got used to its rhythm for example it is quite a funny film with a deep sense of humor something i did not notice at first but was turned on to by another critic and noticed to much delight on further viewings 4 before they pulled it and wouldve gone back for more if this film had been promoted right and people guided to a certain extent as to how to approach it i have no doubt it would have succeeded on the art house circuit like most of antonionis 60s films but the 60s are no more and the film will have to find its audience on the small screen where half its beauty will be lost even in a letterboxed dvd version if and when its released i urge all film nuts general or esoteric to see beyond the clouds and add a piece of magic to the tragic,0,1
2104,style over substance but what a style it is the cell is the internal version of most serial killer movies unfortunately the story hardly supports the visualspsychotherapist catherine deane jlo goes into her patients dreams via artificial means to discover and help them over come their phobias and obsessions a new patient whose fallen into a coma is brought to her attention by the fbi hes a serial killer who drowns his female victims then poses their bodies in grotesque scenarios like mannequins deane must enter the killers mind and navigate through his sick fantasies in order to find and save his latest victim director tarsem singh has incredible visions and set pieces for this production each dream sequence is like a nightmareish painting in motion from the landscapes to the costumes but the plot suffers from lack of history of its characters stargher is the only person with a thorough background and hes the last person you want to care about without him you basically have a movie that moves in the present tense only which is a shame since the movie is so visually stunning and genuinely scary lopez is wasted but shes not that amazing an actress anyway though shes as gorgeous as ever and vince vaughn i dont even know why he was chosen this is not his forte and he overacts to boot he tried too hard to become his character and it showed stick to comedy vince even so this movie is so visually frightening i still watch this movie with the lights on and can never fall asleep right away afterward,0,1

2137,if as i just pointed out in the goat keaton is following the tradition of the comics finding themselves at odds with the law this langdon short the last released before he did tramp tramp tramp was based on another comic ploy being married to a shrewish spouse and trying to get away for some secret twotiming dating laurel hardy did this in several films as did fields and chaplin i have a problem with it why do these characters always marry such nasty women and there is an interesting sociological side issue why dont you find female comics married to male counterparts to these shrews i cant recall any except in a carol burnett skit where the two nastier members of two couples discover that they prefer having someone give it back as good as they get a kind of mutual sadomasochism but also reassurance that their not married to a nambypamby type as for the fact that the comics do marry shrews i suppose one can imagine they get what they deserve or do they ollie really deserves a wife who throws pots and dishes at him yeah he went to that convention in sons of the desert that ruined her plans but he wanted to get some private time there is nothing suggesting he and stan cheated on their wives actually he is creamed by mae busch because he lied to her while stan collapsed and told the truth to his wifehere harrys wife alice ward is shown at the start talking to her mother about how she keeps him under strict control we see harry at his job it is saturday morning and the job ends at noon for the rest of the weekend this was before the idea of a five day a week 40 hour a week job in industry he works in a foundry where he hits red hot metal into shape an early joke about langdon he is a small light man not the muscular type to swing a sledge hammer he just misses his streetcar trying to give a man a light he calls home to explain things and gets an earful from the missus for being two minutes late on the way home harry meets his pal steve vernon dent who has met two nice sweet girls who would just love to have a date harry is hesitant but agrees to it after talking to the girl he agrees to pay for the hotdogs for the foursome he has a 1926 silver half dollar in his pocket but his plans seem derailed when his wife discovers his hidden cache of coins he keeps it hidden under the living room rug and finds it by walking along the edge of the rug but his wife spies on him and confiscates all of it later she overhears him talking to himself and berating her in contempt she gives him back a dime and says he can treat his date to a sodabut harry has a second cache of coins and dresses up for the date and goes out he and dent are apparently late and dent blames harry but harry tries to make it up to him he produces two prostitutes they get into a quarrel when dent wisely says they are not the type of girls hed term as nice eventually the girls do show up and the date begins but soon harry is hiding in the rumble seat as his wife drives past in her roadster and the girls boy friends turn up angry at their two rivalsthe short works well and is amusing and gives one a better idea of the persona that harry langdon developed in his brief stardom as a comic master he is constantly put upon by others he misses his streetcar because some stranger keeps asking for a smoke and a light and in the end the stranger gets his own the nice girl who is harrys date has a little dog who chases him away he rests between two cars that both start driving away and he ends up wrapped around a pole it certainly demonstrates that langdon had his screen persona down pat by the time that he made his features if only he could have kept the complex whole together beyond those three first features,0,1
2158,some films just simply should not be remade this is one of them in and of itself it is not a bad film but it fails to capture the flavor and the terror of the 1963 film of the same title liam neeson was excellent as he always is and most of the cast holds up with the exception of owen wilson who just did not bring the right feel to the character of luke but the major fault with this version is that it strayed too far from the shirley jackson story in its attempts to be grandiose and lost some of the thrill of the earlier film in a trade off for snazzier special effects again i will say that in and of itself it is not a bad film but you will enjoy the friction of terror in the older version much more,0,1
2215,i watched both bourne identity and bourne supremacy on dvd before seeing this in the theater id been waiting for this since before they started filming i wasnt disappointedminor spoilers below overall it was good but it also lacked the continuity of the first two identity and supremacy both flowed gracefully between adrenaline rush action to introspective drama this movie felt choppy at times the plotbuilding downtimes were slightly too drawn out that caused the following action to feel too freneticcamera speaking of frenetic the trademark greengrass shaky cam was present and very annoying to me i know its has been talkedwhined about to nausea on the message board but it doesnt mean its not relevant all the martial arts training the actors went through was totally wasted the ridiculous camera cuts and wiggling camera ruined most of the fighting in the movie it is a cheap student director trick to make the film feel unsettled id expect those techniques to be used in some horror flick made for high school kids but not in this classy adult action series too much extreme closeup also do some framing get some interesting shots constant closeup feels like lazy directing to mestory the story was very confusing at first they thrust new names and faces upon you from the get go gave me the feeling that you get when you come into a movie late and know youve missed some crucial information felt rushed or compressed for time reasons after you catch up however the story is quite good its enjoyable following leads along with bourne however i did not care for the whole last scene of supremacy landybourne on the phone being in the middle of ultimatum thing it basically makes the movie a halfprequel i thought that was awkwardcastcharacters the star of the movie is the action obviously there are only two originals left bourne and nicky parsons them teaming up was kind of odd to me i think they just wanted to give bourne someone to protect to and confide in unless i completely missed something they never even tell you why they teamed up the other assassins in the movie were pretty quiet this felt like gilroygreengrasswhoever wanting to not leave open ends understandable but disappointing seriously damon with clive owen in identity and marton csokas in supremacy those scenes were phenomenal these assassins are as uninteresting as castel the first fella bourne fights in identity the cast in general has degraded as the the series went on clive owen was practically an afterthought thats a measure of strength for that first cast the second they basically trade chris cooper for joan allen not exactly equal this one trades brian cox and franka potente for 3 actors to be named later nothing against david strathairn scott glenn or albert finney but theyre not the first names that come to mind for this kind of series aside from a couple pauses that seemed to long the acting was right onas a whole it was successful felt like they wanted to get the series over with though if they would have trimmed or rearranged the slower parts eliminated scott glenns part entirely zoomed out and taken the camera away from the seizure victim it would have been perfectending spoileri dont see why they leave bourne alive at the end it was my understanding this was the conclusion they clearly made reference to the very beginning of the series with his silhouette floating motionless i thought that was going to be it a full circle type of ending i did like nicky reacting to the news report thoughspoiler specifics warning quote from movie below bournes last line at the end look at this look at what they make you give quoting the first assassin he killed i loved that the final scene was great except that it was vosen strathairn that shot at bourne why would he do that just out for vengeance if he was angry enough to murder why not shoot pamela landy after she faxes his top secret file that didnt make sense,0,1
2216,this is an ok early 80s horror flick in which a young girl meg tilly is wanting to shed her goody two shoes image and becomes part of a girl gang called the sisters their initiation for her consists of spending the night in a mausoleum too bad the mausoleum is the final resting place of some psycho russian psychic and hes not quite dead yet seems this guy was found in his apartment with lots of things stuck into the walls from his telekinetic target practice plus there is a pile of young dead girls found in the closet all proof that hitch hiking can be dangerous so listen up girls the daughter of this man reymar is rather distraught about her fathers death and is confronted by a man that said he knew reymar and given a tape to listen too her hubby adam west of batman fame is there to laugh and scoff and not much else but it seems that perhaps reymars daughter may also have some abilities that she doesnt realize anyway having deposited their unfortunate pledge at the mausoleum the rest of the sisters take off to go get stuff like masks sheets etc to come back and scare the crap out of her but little do they suspect whats going on and they get more than the crap scared out of them for even in death reymar is kind of a busy guy and hes reanimating lots of corpses for entertainment and it would also seem that he has a thing for jail bait overall this is acceptable horror nothing too intense but not terrible either the dvd from media blasters also contains another version of the movie thats a rough cut i guess i only watched a little of it so i dont know how different it is from the theatrical release but from what i saw i guess its a warts and all presentation 7 out of 10,0,1
2225,a number of posters have commented on the unsatisfactory conclusion this is always a problem with long complex dramas crime is essentially banal so the pay off is always anticlimactic whilst detailed exposition detracts from the human drama the writer has used a number of clever devices to try and get round this but has not been entirely successful answers to precisely what happened and why may have been supplied but if so they are well buried the viewer inevitably feels a little cheatedbut in a sense this is unimportant the drama was never about the crime or even the investigation it was about the impact of events on the lives of those involved the family the investigators the witnesses the press and as such it was gripping the writing was a significant cut above the run of the mill for primetime drama and the performances uniformly good in an ensemble piece it is invidious to focus on individuals but penelope wilton deserves special mention for an extraordinary tour de force as the motherwifedaughter and janet mcteer was in cracking form as a hardbitten old copone of the most interesting aspects of the drama is the handling of race as the elephant in the room that noone is prepared to mention subtle powerful stuff,0,1
2230,fata morgana is by far one of the weirdest and most perplexing art films i have ever seen i hesitate to call it a documentary because while is does have elements of documentation of its images the images themselves are so unusual so hallucinogenic so unclear that i wonder whether it was really worth telling this story just so that these images can exist the film basically is the tale of the earth and the creation of the earth shot from the perspective of an outsider be it alien or something otherwise indescribable all taking place in the sahara desert the title of the picture relates to the illusion or reflection of images both real and hallucinated that people in the desert often witness these are also known as miragesthe film opens with a plane landing followed by the plane landing again and then again and again and again and again and again and again with each plane landing shot the actual architecture of both the location it is landing at and the plane itself begin to slowly dissolve into one another and grow less and less real and more and more reflective imagery the imagery in this film only grows more intense and more unusual as the picture continues the narration of the film tells of the creation of the universe as alarming sexual images of sand and landscape move past the camera the shots go further and further into the desert and herzog films whatever he sees and finds the strangest reflections of the world are on display in the distance while herzog meets some of the most pure and photogenic collections of outsiders that you are ever likely to see when the leonard cohen soundtrack kicks in you can be sure that you are in the world of a mad man who is in love with the universei cannot say too much more about this film without ruining anything but i will say that it is a sobering experience and theres really nothing like it i love seeing films that are just in classes of their own this film certainly is a good example of how herzog loves to intermingle narrative storytelling and documentary filmmaking into an interchangeable form fata morgana unfortunately does overstay its welcome just a bit but by the time it nears its end the images will most likely be burned into your mind forever definitely a mustsee for those who are obsessed with the nature and the origin of the universe,0,1
2245,let me make one thing clear for the most part the mentality of those who run the show in hollywood frankly psses me right off in general and even more specifically in relation to its treatment of much loved iconic characters from the pages of comic books why well lets take a typical hollywood executive board meeting scenario to illustrate shall we executive no1 hey theres lots of dollars to be gleaned from superhero flicks these days executive no2 good point lets make one with haste then well do a lucky dip in a hat and pick out a superhero at random to base a film upon the dip takes place and a famous superheroes name is pulled out executive no1 great now who can we get to play the part executive no2 whos a big box office star at the moment executive no1 name of big actor is the in thing this week executive no2 but does he really suit the role i mean he doesnt resemble the character whatsoever executive no1 who cares hes a big name well make the film with him in it anyway executive no2 youre quite right and besides well fill the entire film so chock full of glitzy special effects to appease the moronic masses that no one will ever question it anywaythe above scenario clearly illustrates one of the reasons i generally loath most modern superhero movies all style no substance and simply pathetic casting of the iconic leads of course to be equitable there are exceptions to the above rule when hollywood does get it right take the casting of the original and still easily the best superman christopher reeve and more recently patrick stewart and sir ian mckellen in the xmen filmsbut back to the general negative traits displayed by hollywood today wouldnt it be wonderful if our studio executives were to always choose actors who actually suited the roles well in this less than ideal world one filmmaker does just this believe it or not by casting actors based upon their genuine resemblance to their comic book counterparts his name is sandy collora sadly but typically hollywood has not as of yet allowed collora to direct a full length film but luckily for us he has given us tantalizing glimpses of what the finished outcome would likely look like in the form of two as of yet famous super hero short features one is the superb batmandead end and the other is this mock trailer for an entirely fictitious film called worlds finestwell lets not mince our words here this is absolutely awesome stuffthe casting of mr universe winner and male model michael ohearn who looked similarly awesome but was utterly wasted in the lackluster barbarian makes for the most perfect choice to play the iconic man of steel in fact in terms of physical resemblance there has undoubtedly never been a closer approximation to the comic characteradded to this clark bartram is back fresh from his splendid portrayal as the dark knight in batmandead end again yet another hugely judicious piece of castingwhat can i say if only this was indeed a real full length film hollywood studio executives take note this is how it should be doneas a final note i am once again intrigued by the vastly split reactions this short film has evoked from fans tellingly the most acerbic and vehemently adverse reactions against it clearly come once more as similarly with batman dead end from a younger less cinematically experienced audience a fact betrayed by their somewhat grammatically primitive rants and liberal usage of base diction such an unfortunate state of closed mindedness is indeed a sad phenomenon albeit one that our aforementioned studio executives in hollywood will no doubt derive great satisfaction from after all these very same misguided individuals are in all probability the exact same sort of cgi addicted popcorn stuffing imbeciles that revel in the majority of crap that hollywood churns out by the deluge these days,0,1

immovable as a battleship intends to make the best of it by briskly taking over nutbourne if possible alastair sims pond is exasperated up to his big bald head and is determined to salvage his school in the meantime there are 100 young girls and 170 young boys to be fed and places found for them to sleep along with all their teachers the cooks and caretakers totally put upon walk out miss whitchurch and her girls however are up to the cooking tasks come now angela she says to one girl who is trying to stir something in a big pot havent you made porridge before yes but no one ever had

2260,this film opened to poor showings in the first few weeks then meena kumari died and it just brought the crowds rolling in songs on all india radio especially inhi logon ne were played so often that i was sick of them at the time despite recognising their beauty yes it did take all those years to make this was because the marriage was a very unhappy one and kamal amrohi also had difficulty finding the money to make the film looking at the sumptous sets and costumes not surprising not only does meena kumari age and fall ill but listen carefully to latas voice inhi logon ne has her 50s younger voice while songs that were rerecorded like chalo dildar chalo show clear development i only wish someone would find the ghulam mohammad songs that werent included in the film because of changing fashions that called for fewer though slightly songs and publish them lata in a recent interview 2007 rated ghulam mohammad as one of the best composers she had ever worked with apart from madan mohan a great personal friend notice also that you hardly see the actors at all in the chalo dildar songs very unusual there is only a brief shot of raj kumar from the middle distance and you only see the back of the supposed meena kumari kamal amrohi made a virtue out of necessity and focused on the stars and moon any other film this song would have had closeups of both of themas for this being the finest film ever i would beg to differ it means you have missed a lot of indian cinema in no particular order films like barsaat old devdas older versions bandini do bigha zameen garam hava dastak guddi aan pyasa kagaz ke phool sahib bibi aur ghulam kabuliwallah abhimaan guide sujatha bombay ka babu daag parineeta old umrao jaan etc etc and if you valued music more than story the list would simply grow with beautiful scores from barsat ki raat to naya daur teesri manzil mahal aag jugnu anand mera naam joker the list is really endlessso enjoy pakeezah but dont miss out on any of the above,0,1
2281,like one of the other reviewers might have been amazon i was first introduced to tourist trap by the beloved decrepit old wor9 in ny around january 1983 devil dog the hound of hell which id been waiting to see since it debuted on halloween 1978 had just ended and i thought id had my horror fill for the day quit laughing that three eyed borgost sp monster ike eisenmann draws up in his room is scaryfor as much as i still enjoy richard crenna wearing his madefortv horror hat it was the first 10 minutes of tourist trap following devil dog that day that really left a mark and months later it ended up being the first movie i ever taped off tv wor used to play this fairly frequently often as the saturday afternoon million dollar movie as others have observed its one of those offerings that delivers a powerful horror punch up front a veritable left hook and then practically starts over with the rest of the cast dances and jabs putting the opening scene a larger context along the way then moves on to the real climax see night of the living dead re animatortwo paragraphs and i havent mentioned a single mannequin face it the damn things are scary enough without the music and the script i too can remember some scary dress dummies and the like in various relatives attics and basements and say what you like about how relatively straightforward schmoeller and carrolls approach is no one before or since has played it this well in real life a good mannequin will make you do a double take and here thats about the last thing youre likely to see if you happen to be stuck at slausens defunct wax museum and roadside stand yes there is a point i loved her very much where chuck slausen connors is trying to pass for vincent price yes the plot might have taken up all of a paragraph in the early stages i cant see the script being all that thick it doesnt matter from direction to competent acting meryl streeps emphatically not in attendance and here that helps instead of hinders to another useful and effective pino dinaggio score see carrie and various other de palma movies to various lighting film stock use of varying sound levels i could go on every element of this low budget production comes together and you get a work very much greater than the sum of its partsdid i mention its scary as hell stephen king talked this movie up in danse macabre a year or so after its release and with good reason like much of his work it may not be great art but it sure does tell a scary story and does it well the rest of the cast may be relatively unknown wasnt jocelyn jones in that texas car chase movie as well but chuck connors and tanya roberts were and are just familiar enough to audiences to make you think stephen king style that this could happen to you or people you knowcomparisons to psycho plot and the texas chainsaw massacre overall look and feel even if they arent the first associations in my mind are valid i only wish i could comment on the dvd which i look forward to buying as tourist trap has become notoriously hard to find on video since the nearcomplete extinction of independent video rental outlets where it had a home aside from wor and cable in the 1980s though tmcshowtime appear to have picked it up and play it regularly now no no spoilers here im afraid no plot breakdown go see it yourself all right there may be a tiny little one below so scroll away if you like better safe than sorry the mannequins are damn scary and id rather show than tell for the record tourist trap is also chock full of great lines from we are going to have a party how do i look huh how do i look to youre so pretty you cant hurt me i shouldnt have to hide it it feels good listen for that vincent price inflection again there the inevitable youre crazy delivered at the right moment and in the right tone and try just try to keep the hair on your arms down when you hear the mannequins head screaming molly especially once you realize whose head it used to be p s charles band was the producer on this i believe and likely owned the rights to dinaggios music band from what i understand was the brains behind full moon entertainment which might explain both the musics subsequent use in puppet master and well the 40 commercial approach has characterized full moon throughout from the enjoyable puppet master and subspecies franchises to uhhh trancers and bad channels sorry boc,0,1
2300,there i was sitting alone in my flat on a saturday night with the choice of watching citizen x or the eurovision song contest and for the benefit of americans reading this ill explain that tesc is an annual event where musicians from countries all over europe and asia minor have a song contest at the end of the contest countries vote to see what the best song was its a contest that is even less exciting than it sounds and it may not come as a shock when i say that singing and songwriting isnt of the calibre of lennon and mccartney and i should correct something in the first sentence of this review because the word choice is misleading because being a music lover i wasnt going to watch tesc under any circumstanceso i sat down as the credits rolled for citizen x expecting a run of mill serial killer whodunnit but id be misleading everyone calling it that its obvious within the first 10 minutes of citizen x whodunnit what the film does is point out the failures of communism a serial killer comrade this is the soviet union serial killers can only exist in decadent imperialist capitalist systems this farcical attitude goes far beyond denial theres a scene where an undercover cop sits in a freezing train station keeping an eye out for potential suspects whilst wearing his police jacket because its the only warm coat hes got and of course all suspects who are members of the communist party are released without interrogation something which will affect the final death toll all this is very well done as we are shown that its the communist party system thats on trial but about two thirds of the way through citizen x we find ourselves in 1990 as communism is on its last legs and reforms to the police investigation have taken place its at this point that the film becomes rather uninteresting due to a lack of political subtext and the film descends into an average manhunt film but dont let that put you off citizen x is an intelligent thriller well played by the cast especially donald sutherland as a paternal police chiefstrangely enough a few years ago i read something written by the famous criminologist colin wilson in which he said something along the lines that serial killers let themselves get caught so that they will be the center of attention in the media spotlight and i found myself almost sympathising the party chiefs denying there could be a serial killer in the soviet union after all media is controlled by the party and anyone whos old enough to have listened to radio moscow or read english translations of pravda will know that the ussr only reported news stories like potato harvests coal production and thank you letters from afghanistan cuba etc for soviet assistance the concept of becoming a serial killer in a communist system is illogical but i guess if a tree falls in a remote siberian forest it will still make a sound even though no one is around to hear it,0,1

2372,utterly tactical strange watch for the kinky moment of a dropdead gorgeous blonde acting as pullstring doll for some rich folks pointless but undoubtedly compelling latenight feature this unhinged french production is a stew of perplexedly unfocused ideas and random plot illustrations centred on its very charismatic stars if somewhat antiheroes alain delon and charles bronson really they dont get to do all that much especially during the confined lengthy midsection where they hide themselves in a building during the christmas break to crack a safe with 10000 possible combinations oh fun but this is when the odd if intriguing relationship is formed between delon and bronsons characters after a manipulative battle of wills and childishly sly games against each other the two come to an understanding that sees them honour each others involvement and have a mutual respect this would go on to play a further part in the twisty second half of the story with that undetectable curveball still their encounters early on suggest theres more but what we get is vague and this is magnified by that what just happen there ending that might just make you jump yeeeeaaaaahhhhhhhhh glad to get that out of the system the pacing is terribly slow but placidly measured for it and this seems purposely done to exhaust with its edgy nervous underlining tension watch as the same process is repeated over and over again and you know something is not quite right and the scheming eventually comes into play now everything that does happen feels too spontaneous but the climax payoff is haunting the taut complex script is probably a little too crafty for its own good but there are some neat novelties coins glass and liquids try not spilling and visual symbolisms jean hermans direction is efficiently sophisticated and lowkey but get a tad artificial and infuse an unwelcoming icy atmosphere the sound fx features more as a potent note than that of francois deroubaixs funky score thats mainly kept under wrapped after its sizzling opening top drawers delon whos quite steely and bronson a jovial turn are solid and work off each tremendously bernard fresson chalks up the attitude as the inspector who knows theres more going on than what is being led on an attractive female cast features able support by brigitte fossey and olga georgespicot a cryptically directionless but polished crime drama maintained by its two leads and some bizarre inclusions,0,1
2420,all the reviewers are making one big mistake this movie was not suppose to be taken seriouslyit was made for kids and teens of the late 80ies or early 90ies and as such it was truly a film of its time if you hated that period or love the first movie so much that you cant even take a joke about it then this is garbage but only because it wasnt meant for you the low budget here and failure of the beastmaster 1 at the box office grossed under four mil with a nine mil budget were obviously the reasons to drop the seriousness of the original and to put it in the present day you can complain about the story dialog or logic but again this was made to run not to win races if the movie had tried to take itself seriously it would be a total failure but it doesnt do that for a second in our world dar sees a movie theater thats advertising the beastmaster 2 enough said to paraphrase clint eastwood from dirty harry movies this movie knows its limitations its more of a comedyparody then usual adventure soundtrack for the time was also great actors arent taking themselves that seriously either so even the usually irritating spoiled rich brat role played here very well by young kari wuhrer turns out good so if you are nostalgic for the 80ies90ies cheese culture or you liked the first part and dont mind going out on a cheese limb youll have tremendous fun with this attempt to revive dar in the 90ies literarly this is not really the sequel to the first and dont watch it if thats what you want its more of a what if fantasy sequelas for the why different dimension and not just different time question when in history did we have those tall winged humanoid creatures that suck the flash of bones from the end of part 1 by the way the movie ends in the zoo because of an attempt at a cheap moneywise big finale its suppose to be the best place for dar to show all his moves him being the manipulator of animals,0,1

2440,what is most disturbing about this film is not that school killing sprees like the one depicted actually happen but that the truth is they are carried out by teenagers like cal and andrenormal kids with normal families by using a hand held camera technique a la blair witch ben coccio succeeds in bringing us into the lives of two friends who have some issues with high school although we arent ever told exactly what is behind those issues they seem to be typical a lot of people hate high school so what a part of you just doesnt believe they will ever carry out the very well thought out massacre on zero day the surveillance camera scenes in the school during the shooting are made all the more powerful for that reason you cant believe its really happening and that its really happened the hand held camera technique also creates the illusion that this is not a scripted movie a brilliant idea given the subject matter,0,1

2493,whenever an idea was successful during those golden days of the silent movies you could bet your bottom dollar that it would be repeated although reworking is the term that is used of course one could make the argument that this reworking business has never left us for success in the movies or tv always leads to a trend with all competing parties vying to come up with their own version of said hit movie or tv programto this last premise we strongly disagree for this is copycatting or plagiarism plain and simplethis the last silent laurel hardy short surely must have been quite well received for angora love hal roachmgm 1929 was reworked on the roach lot not once but twice over the next three years we were treated to laughing gravy roachmgm 1931 in which the goat was replaced with a cute little puppydog also the weather is transformed into the dead of winter in the middle of a blizzard they also made other lineup changes with substituting landlord edgar kennedy with landlord charlie hallthe second reworking of the hidden animal premise is the 3 reeler the chimp roachmgm 1932 which substituted a female ape from a dissolved and defunct circus to which stan and babe were former employees the circus paid off its employees with their assets and the boys received the chimpanzee as their final paydayback to our original victim todays subject angora love recomember the short starts off simply enough the boys encounter the goat on the street and the nanny in return follows them back to their rooming house after stan feeds a doughnut to her the comic moments that follow are generated with the interplay between l h and slowburn exponent edgar kennedy their landlord the incidents impact is amplified by having the interplay occur at night and as luck would have it their room is situated directly above the landlords quartersin addition to the noise the bathing of the goat its odor and landlord edgars suspicions about laurel hardys having another person illegally in the room we were most amused by a little throwaway gag which may well have been missed by the censors while admonishing the boys about the noise theyd been making and reminding them of the house rules about any unauthorized persons being in there overnight regardless of their sexits camera shot is made from inside the boys room over their shoulder with edgar in the hall and facing them he warns remember this is a respectable establishment just as he says this a lady clad in evening clothes walks across and behind the landlord followed by a uniformed sailor who cocks his hat forward as they pass poodle schnitz,0,1
2508,as a former highland rugbyhr player i feel like i can possibly answer some of the questions and confusion that has been put forward i think that i am also in a position to offer some insight into the club and back stories oh and this is gonna be a long post i can tell alreadyfirst off the people who said that the movie doesnt show real rugby have a valid point the movie is full of bad tackles people in the wrong places and much much more if you want to know what a real rugby game feels like you wont get the best idea from this movie but the thing is anything short of actually sitting down and watching a highlight reel or jumping into a game yourself is not going to be satisfactory its hollywood not espn really how many sports movies really make you feel like you are in the game not many that i have seen i think its important to keep in mind that the movie is about rugby players much more than it is about rugbynext the haka is very much a part of highland rugby it is not something that they just threw into the movie to be honest i dont know how the tradition got started but highland emulates the all blacks in many ways the uniform is based off of the all blacks as well the movie did not do a good job of explaining the origins of the haka and to be honest i dont think that that is right but i can tell you that every member of the team knows exactly where it comes from and what it means as for the person from china who said that only a maori can perform a haka i would suggest that they take a look at the all blacks and tell me if they think that they are all maori believe it or not utah has a very large polynesian community and a good portion of them like and play rugby for the local teams i myself am part hawaiian whenever possible the haka is led by a maori the team does not do it because they think that they are maori they do it because of some of the issues shown in the movie the concept of unity and those who have gone before is a huge part of the hr culture and the message behind the haka for any of those that are familiar with it support those values its a chant by a chief who thought he would die ka mate and those around him supporting him telling him he will live ka ora and boosting him up how appropriate it is for a bunch of white boys to do it is not for me to say but that is the ideology behind it and why it is done kia kaha is also a well used team motto even if the actors had a hard time saying italso for the people who questioned highlands rugby playing ability i would just remind you that you were not really watching highland play in this movie many of the extras were former players from highland and other teams but the main characters were all actors believe it or not highland really is pretty good at what they do and pretty well respected in the international community granted some years produce better teams than others its what you would expect with any sports team but you dont accumulate hrs win record by just being okay the year after i graduated 1998 highland was one of 12 teams to be invited to the world schools rugby championship in zimbabwe the teams were hand picked from around the world and represented the best of high school rugby talent at the time highland obviously didnt win first place new zealand did that but they did manage to take third place in the tournament beating the tongan national champions in their last match and while american rugby may never reach the level of talent that new zealand or south africa has third in the world is also nothing to hang your head about highland also has a tradition of touring new zealand every few years and usually comes back with more wins than lossesthe majority of characters portrayed in this movie are based off of real people and real stories i watched this movie with my brothers who also played for highland and between the four of us we were fairly certain that we were able to identify almost every main character nobody knew a white rasta of course as this wasnt a documentary hollywood did take some liberties but to tell you the truth not as many as you might think the film was actually pretty accurate in showing the 2 and a half hour daily practices as well as the mandatory personal running and weight training sometimes it really was running until you threw up it also showed the service and other team activities like the chuckarama buffet that were very much a part of team bondingand finally the movie in my obviously very biased opinion it was a pretty good movie and i think that the reason for it is that i watched it as an inspirational sports movie i didnt think that it would be a pure rugby movie or an academy award winning drama it was just an uplifting movie about a rugby team complete with morals encouragement and a good dose of jokes thrown in for entertainment i hope that i addressed some of the problems that people have had with the movie and hope that you can now enjoy it for what it waskia kaha,0,1
2547,well first of all i am a big fanatic of horror movies but however i am pretty sick of all those damn american horror movies they are all about the same thing blood and violence its not even creepy well its nothin wrong with the blood and all that doesnt even bother me but thats not what makes a movie creepy thats why i find this movie entertaining its fun to see a satire which is making fun of the koncept main horror usa american splattergoremovies they are not suppose to be creepy only funny thats ok but when theyre suppose to be creepy it mostly gets pathetic however there are a few great american horror movies poltergeist psycho birds but in the end its all the same thing thats why this movie came as a relief evil ed is not just a cult movie its a classic i cant wait untill master director anders jacobsson makes another goddamn splatter movie untill than i have to watch evil ed again and again and again but i dont care it is such an outstanding movie,0,1
2549,house of dracula isnt all that bad of a film and is rather decent at timesspoilersarriving at the home of dr franz edelmann onslow stevens in his seaside home count dracula john carradine discreetly seeks a cure for vampirism he starts work on a potential cure involving blood transfusion the wolf man lawrence talbot lon chaney jr arrives at his estate looking for a cure to lycanthropy working with the two patients he discovers a possible cure in a mold found near the laboratory and after searching the area he finds the frankenstein monster glenn strange buried nearby becoming obsessed with reviving it dr edelmann keeps neglecting dracula and larrys requests and after demanding that they get their treatment instead of him working on the monster they turn on each other in a climactic showdownthe good news this was a rather decent film there is one main idea that is quite creative and imaginative this is the first film to openly propose the idea of vampirism as a blood disease and one that can be transferred from person to person through the exchange of bodily fluid something that would be taken up by later genre works but rarely as directly as this theres even a microscope slide of the parasite that is believed responsible for the condition it works in some rather nicely used ideas and comes across as a rather nifty idea even if some of the execution is a little stale the fact that each of the creatures has at least one standout scene is a nicely done idea the wolf man has a marvelous scene where he transforms inside a prison cell to the doubting members of the search party and goes crazy draculas initial appearance of appearing as a bat and flying toward a prone figure sleeping and then appearing in human form looks really impressive the monster rampage is well handled and an appropriate amount of destruction is caused the large bat that dracula transforms into always looks decent for once and is quite realistically done its a thoroughly decent affairthe bad news there are several things that werent all that great about this one the fact that the film combines so much potentially intriguingly plots and ideas that it really doesnt know what to do with them there are several different backstories that have to be mingled together and which should be clear enough to mix well together and seem coherent this really doesnt have any of that the plot is rather flimsy and doesnt really give a preferential treatment to any of the stars and instead concentrates on one then another and then includes all three in the ending the monsters only seem to get engaged with each other for the smallest possible reason makes it a big distraction the ending is for once a big letdown and seems entirely like it was changed at the last minute theres a few other small things that werent all that spectacular and pretty much also contribute to thisthe final verdict its quite a decent film and manages to get through most of the time with an entertaining style nowhere near the classic status of each monsters debut features but its a nice enough watch for fans of the monsters and of universal films in generaltodays ratingpg violence,0,1

2623,going for something far away from the deliberately gross stuff that he usually makes john waters happy birthday john made this parody of the celebrityart world edward furlong plays the title character a workingclass teenager in baltimore who loves to photograph things when a new york agent lili taylor discovers his work she offers him his big break which he accepts but once he hits it big he has to reconsider everythingbasically pecker looks at how he loses his friends and his normal life once he becomes a celebrity the sort of thing that we might expect sure but with waters directing theres always a few things to shock us youll know them when you see them i certainly recommend it also starring christina ricci mink stole and patty hearst,0,1

2690,nuri bilge ceylans 2002 film distant uzak his third feature film his first was 1997s black and white the small town kasaba is a significant step up from his good but flawed 1999 film clouds of may mayis sikintisi the earlier film had potential but reeked of a small budget and improvised quality in the worst ways plot holes and wooden acting from amateurs that clouds of may succeeded on any level was a testament to ceylans talent as a budding filmmaker however distant is ceylans arrival on the international scene as a great artist one who has many of the same qualities as other great filmmakers like ingmar bergman although his screenplay is not as dialogueheavy it is just as brooding and he lacks bergmans penchant for closeups his shots are usually long shots for exteriors and medium shots for interiors and yasujiro ozu whose penetrating scenes of contemplation ceylan reconfigures the bulk of the film takes place in snowy hibernal istanbul the fact that it snows in turkey will likely surprise some which lends the film a definite bergmanian feel as well as reminding one of some of the bleak snowy urban images from krzysztof kieslowskis the decalogue the natural images invoke the best of werner herzog as they tend to go on a beat or two longer than standard film theory would dictate which is what makes them even more memorable while the urban landscapes range from the nearly precisionist compositions of michelangelo antonioni to the cultural hagiography of woody allen one shot of a bench overlooking water is a direct quotation read steal from manhattan save the lack of the brooklyn bridge in the background in another scene ceylan similarly quotes a famous shot of a ship in the harbor from ozus tokyo story yet like all great artists ceylan makes his appropriations his own art by slightly altering them and keeping them apropos to his own films needs distant is a film whose title suffuses the characterization within the film and the feeling some viewers will have toward them but it does not describe the film itself for scenes stay with one long after the film ends perhaps the most memorable scene and image of the film comes when mahmut stalks his exwife at the istanbul airport and watches her with her new husband as they head to board the plane that will remove her from his life forever as he watches her from a distance we see her catch just a glance of him watching her will she leave her husband and return to mahmut not in this film he pulls back behind a column and nazan merely turns her head back to her future mahmut is her past and she knows how to best move on just keep moving mahmut will never get it most rarely get such moments of insight into themselves of life that some viewers will get the film and that ceylan gets his own powers of creation shows that ignorance can teach as long as one moves about it distant does albeit it at just the right length,0,1
2694,i have certainly not seen all of jean rollins films but they mostly seem to be bloody vampire naked women fests which if you like that sort of thing is not bad but this is a major departure and could almost be cronenberg minus the biomechanical nightmarish stuff except its in french with subtitles of course a man driving on the road at night comes across a woman that is in her slippers and bathrobe and picks her up while in the background yet another woman lingers wearing nothing as they drive along its obvious that there is something not right about the woman in that she forgets things almost as quickly as they happen still though that doesnt prevent the man from having sex with her once they return to paris his apartment the man leaves for work and some strangers show up at his place and take the woman away to this tower block a huge apartment building referred to as the black tower where others of her kind for whom the no memory things seems to be the least of their problems are being held for some reason time and events march by in the movie which involve mostly trying to find whats going on and get out of the building for this woman and she does manage to call robert the guy that picked her up in the first place to come rescue her the revelation as to whats going on comes in the last few moments of the movie which has a rather strange yet touching end to it in avoiding what seemed to be his typical formula rollin created in this what i feel is his most fascinating and disturbing film i like this one a lot check it out 8 out of 10,0,1

2698,i have read many comments on this site criticizing the blob for being cheesy and or campy the movie has been faulted for amateurish acting and weak special effects what would you expect from a group of folks whose only experience has been in the production of low budget locally produced valley forge pa christian shorts let me tell those overly critical reviewers that this film never took itself all that serious that fact should be evident from the mismatched theme music complete with silly lyrics played over the opening credits for what it was meant to be this film is excellent i have seen a few of the recent ultra low budget attempts blair witch project was one of them that have absolutely no entertainment value or intelligent thought behind their plot bwp was pure excrement the blob on the other hand was well thought out well scripted and thoroughly entertaining the scene where the old man comes across the meteorite and pokes the mass contained within with a stick was excellently done and genuinely creepy the scene in the doctors office with the blob slowly moving under the blanket on the gurney while it consumed the old man was a cinematic horror masterpiece bottom line is i love this movie i challenge anyone out there to take 12000000 inflated for todays dollar value and make a film anywhere near as entertaining and or as successful as the blob it just cant be done period thank you for taking time to read this review,0,1
2737,im certain that people from usa dont know anything about the rest of the world but i think they mustnt talk about what they dont know and they must remember that the rest of the world is not as hypocrite as the usa the only places where consented sex between teenagers are illegal are the usa and islamic nations in france for instance the age of consent is 15 in brazil its 14 in spain its 12 so the teenagers actors 16 and 17 years old by the time of production arent doing anything illegal nudity isnt considered big deal in almost all civilized countries and only a freak could consider a teenagers love as child molestation,0,1
2758,i think every critic who panned tommy boy when it was released in 1995 ought to go back and watch it and learn it is not a bad film at all every critic panned chris farley and david spades movies yes coneheads was funny but kind of had a one joke premise and black sheep i agreed with the critics is one of the worst movies ever made but tommy boy does not fall in the category of coneheads which could have been a little funnier and black sheep which is a piece of tripe it is very funny and entertaining i do agree with the critics that chris farley was no john belushi or john candy as he claimed to have idolized those guys and those guys had a genius for comedy but chris farley was very funny and i wish he were around longer to prove to critics that yes he was no john belushi or john candy but he was very funny the scenes between farley and spade as nemesis are sidesplitting hilarious and the premise is also laugh out loud hilarious it is very sad that chris farley is no longer here to make us laugh but we have movies like tommy boy to remember how truly funny he was tommy boy is one of the 1990s best comedies,0,1
2761,this movie shows life in northern cameroon from the perspective of a young french girl france dalens whose father is an official for the colonial french government and whose family is one of the few white families around it gives a sense of what life was like both for the colonists and for the natives with whom they associated its a sense consistent with another movie ive seen about africa in a similar time period nirgendwo in afrika 2001 but i have no way of knowing how realistic or typical it is its not just an impression things do happen in the movie but the plot is understated the viewer is left to draw his own conclusions rather than having the filmmakers forced upon him although the framing of the story as a flashback from the womans visit to southwestern cameroon as an adult provides some perspective,0,1
2825,the melting mana tragic victim of the space race he perished meltingnever comprehending the race had long gone bya man burr debenning burns his hand on the kitchen stove but instead of screaming something a normal person would scream he shouts something that sounds like aaaaatchkah this movie youve popped inisnt a normal movie youve just taken your first step into the incredible melting man the famous late70s gore film featuring rick bakers wonderful makeup effects baker was just on the edge of becoming a superstar and did this at the same time as his famous cantina aliens in star wars for some strange reason star wars became a household name and incredible melting man did not it might have something to do with the fact that this movie is just mindnumbingly awful from the opening credits starring alex rebar as the incredible melting manthats really what it says to the chubby nurse running through a glass door to the fishermans head going over a waterfall and smashing graphically apart on some rocks this film provides many many moments of sheer incomprehensibility why did theybut how come hewhy are they after a while you give up wondering why and watch it as what it isa very entertaining piece of garbagean astronaut returns to earth in a melting radioactive condition he escapes and his mind disintegrating as well as his body begins a mad melting killing spree the authorities quickly decide that the melting man must be stopped but probably not wanting to cause a panic want him captured as quietly as possible so they send one guy with a geiger counter after him wowstorywise surprisingly little happens during the movie the melting guy wanders around killing people a doctor searches for him with a geiger counter various characters are introduced ask questions and leave eventually the doctor catches up with the melting man but is shot by a security guard for no reason after he explains that hes dr ted nelson the melting man wanders off and finally dissolves into a big puddle of goo the endits so brainless that it somehow ends up being a lot of fun despite a fairly downbeat ending supposedly a widescreen dvd release is planned a very special movie,0,1
2841,peter boyle was always a great actor and he proved it by his performance as a gunho bigot making me hate him everytime he used the n word i watched him and his big mouth and wanted to punch his lights out just think peter boyle was a monk once now a supporting actor in everybody loves raymond susan sarandon making her first debut need a bath right away and enjoyed sharing it with someone else in his own dirty water i noticed a large raggerty ann dollcreator john gruelle was the only thing that susan could actually trust and love and the doll appeared in quite a few scenes if you really want to know about the way out 70s with drugs free love and pipe dreams then enjoy the excellent direction of john g avildsen rocky and the karate kid i always thought that peter boyle should have been blown away in the end this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others,0,1

2846,sleeper cell attempts to swim both sides of the pool terrorismpatriotic muslim americans and it does neither very welli had put off watching this show for a very long time because i had a feeling it would be too predictable but after a year in my netflix queue i finally moved it up to the frontthe show is about an undercover muslim man working for the fbi in an attempt to infiltrate a terrorist cell operating in the united states the undercover agent in the show actually is a muslim so we see his conflictresolution between his patriotism and his religious beliefs personally i would have rather watched a drama about a muslin american family living in the united states but it is doubtful that an america tv channel cable or network will ever produce anything that shows muslims in a flattering lighti am not a muslim but i have a lot of muslim american friends and i can honestly say that none of them are terrorists and they all love americasleeper cell comes close to busting stereotypes of muslims but it also focuses on the worse muslim stereotypes in the first episode we see an honor killing which is a very poor portrayal of islam but in the 3rd episode we see a very respected moderate muslim scholar teaching the viewer that the real jihad is actually a personal struggle that is not meant to incite violence towards othersif only the moderate muslim scholar had been the main character of the showamericans need to learn a lot more about islam sleeper cell helps a little bit but it comes up far short of giving the america audience what it really needs to knowsthat said the acting in this show is superb and the drama is extremely engrossing if only they had made this show about islam in america without the terrorism it would have been first rate,0,1
2870,page 3 is one of those films madhur bhandarkar makes to expose societal filth the film is compelling but like most of bhandarkars films it is onesided and overly pessimistic this film is all about tabloid journalism gossip celebrities the film exposes the lives of socialites whose lifestyle is disastrously boastful peculiar and repulsive they party they care for nothing but fame they plan parties at funerals they are craving for more money and a higher reputation they will do anything to get due exposure in the media to get their names boldly printed on the daily newspapers social column known as page 3 with huge photographs which will be the center of peoples discussions they are attention seeking salacious and hypocrite the film industry is shown as sleazy with casting couch being a common phenomenon among filmmakers thats where our lovely heroine a young social column reporter madhvi sharma is thrown all these people from mumbais elite depend on her articles and she is the right person to befriend at these parties if you want her to mention you in her article later in the film we learn that even those who are madhvis friends are no different from these highsociety people this was tough viewing for me although the film is unquestionably brave and the issues it deals with are interestingthe films music is average the only passable songs are kitne ajeeb and huzooreala sung by the two melody queens lata mangeshkar and asha bhosle respectively otherwise the soundtrack is bad one song which was particularly horrendous is filmy very filmy the films writing is quite good the second half is far better than the first as it turns more matteroffact and exposes much more important issues such as terrorism and child abuse thats where the film has to be applauded it was sad to know that people prefer to ignore such crimes out of fear and konkona sen sharmas characters disappointment was very easy to relate to she was excellent throughout the film and her acting in the last few scenes was particularly impressive atul kulkarnis part was very small but he did full justice to it boman irani is solid as the newspapers editor sandhya mridul is lovable as madhvis sassy roommate pearl who marries an older man for money and is honest enough to admit it the films ending is really welldone and provides a certain sigh of relief after the unimaginably tough proceedings page 3 is a good film it is interesting and at times moving but the level of its interest and its general quality are marred by its exaggerated overly messy and negative portrayal of the rich and famous,0,1
2872,i dont know how i would feel if i lived in usa i would watch some preview scenes advertisements i would know sidney pollack directed it harrison ford and kristin scott thomas starring in i would watch this film as soon as possible without reading any bad review would i be disappointmenti read a lot of review which is said how bad this film was this is boring long film without passion emotions and it is not interesting harrison is wooden cold the sublots should be cut too serious particularly for harrison ford i am interested in the subject and i like harrison ford in the films which are not actions i like sidney pollack and kristin scott thomas too so reading the reviews on imdb website then in other sites then in february in the hungarian movie magazines i was wonder and wonder what the film was anyway there are films directors stars whatwho i want to see despite any reviewsi can understand people who thinks this film is boring and cold and has got not any passion but i feel different it is true i liked sliding doors the forbidden woman this is a french film i dont know what its title in english or in french basic of these films is development of a lovei think random heart is a nice and interesting film in its own wayit may be true that the sublots the congress election and the cops investigation after a corrupt policeman are not written well are not worked out in details but add something to the leading woman and man characterafter his wifes death and betrayal emotion angry of dutch comes to the surface during his work he will be suspicious and almost lost his best friend then the woman too the film shows two ways to survive the tragedy our wifehusbands death and cheating one of them is the womans this is tragedy but the life is continuing she doesnt want to mourn forever what she wants to knowwhat her husbands loverthe cops wife thought about her she will not learn never she is forced to behave in this way the elections are comes and anything about his husband may become scandal she wants her daughter not to be disappointment with her father the man is a cophe suffering from the fact he lived in lies he wants to know maybe every men would want to know in this situationwhen his wife started to cheat him how long had she got lover he needs the womans help but she doesnt want but the guy is stubborn and steadypersistent the woman cant stand him because he always steps into her life and she cannot forget their relationship is tense at the beginning then slowly developments a type of silent sympathy which is prefer an alliance against the outside world the tragedy i said it in spite of that they made love in bed however the cop cant stop with investigation cant stop close and cant allow the woman close to him but he starts the love and the woman wants their relationship to continue but it cant the woman realizes it the end is a bit sad but logic and nice at the same timeit was pleasant for me to see again peter coyotei like this mans face sidney pollack i hardly knew bonnie hunt but she was goodi think harrison ford did an okay job his eardrop is unusual but at the beginning then finally i believed that the woman liked being at his company in spite of his temperament it was pity he had not got any joke but ford has got a good sense of humour a reviewer noticed in hungary ford is charismatic against his haircut and ear drop and we are waiting for his presence and would like him to smile at us and make an ironic notice but dr jones is not smiling at us but he smiles at the end and it is soooo good with the rest i agree i very like him in this role he is good in acting of this a bit rough cool but somewhere in his soul smart cop the character of kristin scott thomas is a woman who is determined self confident but she is closed inside a ivory tower and she keeps aloof from her emotions but she is a really woman who become indecisive and find support on the copthe two cool reserved people find each othermaybe the script is not good it is full of common banal sentence but there are some humorous sentences from the woman and movement particularly from the man it is a good film but not for everybody not for the general big audience i watched the females under 18 and males above 45 liked this film better about the latter maybe sidney pollack made this film for his agegroup which doesnt go to multiplex anyway i advice the people who like energetic plots with action scenes who like only fords action films miss this movie,0,1
2885,i saw this at the bendfilm festival friday amid an unsettled crowd of people not helped by a poor decision by the planners of the event who chose a totally inappropriate short film to precede the movie and it really threw the audience when modern love came up after a light whimsical short name i forget people it was really silly to mix this short with modern love which is a serious drama movie a film film so the audience gets the teaser which is a comedy and thenmodern love hmmmm modern love despite my reservations strange ending a little too tangentialneeded a short film that was commensurate with its oddball strangeness so my advice to the programmers for next year is to take more care planning the showthe folks watching modern love really just didnt know what had hit them they were led up the path and this is not their faultmodern love has some superb performances which play well against the tangential meanderings of the film a film that its maker seems to have wondered out loud rather than executed in the normal way a film is scripted and shottoo bad the audience was misinformed wrong session placement wrong short film wrong approach by the well intentioned programmers who despite good efforts need to see a lot more films and travel to some other festivals,0,1
2960,following the advice of a friend i got myself this movie im very fond of computers in general hence why a 1995 film about identity theft on the internet could not be left unseen i had some bad echoes about it but in the end i wasnt so disappointed the story though classical is kind of interesting and must have been really new back in the days when it was released in theatres i was gladly surprised when i figured out that contrary to what we usually see computerperformed actions are somehow realistic as they use windows 3x and normal computers the storytelling is median and not bothering the viewer the end is typically american the actors performance is globally ok sandra bullock usually annoys me with her oh my god why me way to behave but this time she seems to have controlled herself id recommend that movie,0,1

2989,for the longest time i liked this movie better than the original care bears movie well last summer i watched them both together and decided i was wrong the first one is a better care bears movie as you may have guessed if you read my review for it this one isnt a bad movie its just very strangewell first of all as a few people have mentioned it completely disavows any knowledge of the first movie i cant think of another sequel that contradicts the original so blatantly especially with the genders of some characters and how they all met when i was little and watching this i was quite a bit confused and distraught i felt the same way watching it as an adulton to the reasons why the movie is actually pretty good if you disassociate it from the first movie i cant think of another movie for little kids with a demon as its villan now i am not for a minute suggesting that evil demons who want to steal the souls of campers and care bears are good i just find it cool that theres a supremely evil being in a movie for little kids its like that bizzare santa clause vs satan movie from mexico you hear about sometimes anyhow the demons name is darkheart and he wants this chick to help him get the care bears in return for him giving her special powers very dark for a kiddy flick eh and did i mention that darkheart appears to the girl most often as a whiney voiced 10 year old boy freaky meanwhile some other kids are in carealot looking after baby care bears oh man demons and baby care bears in the same movieneedless to say everything gets cleared up in the end but not before we get to see darkheart trap the care bears souls in this scary chandelere thing in one surprisingly deeply disturbing scene but i am left with the question of wether this movie has found the cult audience it so richly deserves i might just watch it again myself,0,1
3005,this is the start of a new and interesting star trek series it has a down to earthkind of feel with darker and less plaggy scenographythe characters need some more time to develop but they have potential one thing that is fairly disappointing with all star trek series really is that they portray such a gloomy picture of the equality between men and women in the future when they paint a very positive picture about everything else earth has stopped war famine etc the female characters here are two subcommander tpol who is vulcan and communications officer hoshi who is human hoshi is quite wimpy and tpol is made to be a vulcan babe some of the crew attitudes feel a bit too american as opposed to the more international feel of the tngcrew but creates interesting dynamics a very good pilot though for a very good series,0,1

3108,jack frost 2 is probably the most cheesiest movie i have ever seen in my life the complete title of the film is jack frost 2 revenge of the mutant killer snowman horror movie fans that have a taste for campy story lines will be delighted to watch this this film was straight to video and for good reasons heres why the acting was so atrocious and so terrible that it could cause one to cry the main character had no personality and the actors bad acting made it all worse the screenplay was was also atrocious each character always says a cheesy line and add the cheesy lines to the bad choreography then you have something bad second the story line isnt really all that impressive but since this movie was straight to video it is forgiven the director and writer could have turned the idea of a killer snowman into something cool but they didnt they story has lots of plot holes in it in the beginning a cup of coffee gets knocked into the fish tank with the melted jack frost scientists try to restore his life but they couldnt once the cup of coffee fell into the tank jack frost was completely restored now he is immune to antifreeze in jack frost part 1 the main characters dna got mixed up with the antifreeze that was used to kill jack frost since the main character is allergic to bananas jack frost is too hence heres my point they say that sams dna combined with jack frosts but one of the scientists had some saliva on the cup so when it fell into the tank the scientists dna would have been combined with jack frosts another thing the special effects werent very good either heres the good points jack frost 2 has lots of blood that looks pretty realistic even though this movie is flawed to hell it is still entertaining overall jack frost 2 is an enjoyable horror movie the first one was better though 7 out of 10,0,1
3117,okay ill say it this movie made me laugh so hard that it hurt this statement may offend some of you who may think that this movie is nothing more than a waste of film but the thing that most people dont get is that this movie was intended to be bad and cheezy i mean did people actually think that a movie about a killer snowman was intended to be a masterpiece just look at the scary hologram on the jacket of the movie and youll find your answer instead like the original jack frost which i thought was just as funny this movie turned out to be a sidesplitting journey into the depths of corny dialogue bad one liners and horrible special effects and its all made to deliver laughter to us viewers it certainly worked for mefor example anne tiler to her troubled husband what makes you frown so heavily darlingif that chunk of dialogue doesnt make you laugh then you have serious issues who in their right mind would utter those words in real life of course no one because it was meant to sound ridiculous just take one viewing of this movie with an open mind and low expectations and hopefully youll see whats so damn funny about jack frost 2,0,1
3128,footprints on the moon is almost certainly the strangest most convoluted and most atypical giallo ever made it may come as a restraint to some of the sub genres fans but this film doesnt feature many of the regular giallo trademarks like bloody knife murders preferably committed by a masked killer wearing black gloves ravishing scantily dressed beauties and unpredictable red herrings however to compensate for all this and much more footprints benefices from the most indescribably mysterious and nonstop compelling atmosphere i ever experienced in this type of film the level of mystery in this movie is so high and unbearable it literally makes you feel uncomfortable and scared like the female protagonist alice cespi herself you absolutely have no idea of whats happening or why and this feeling of utter powerlessness is unquestionably the films main strongpoint as a viewer you crave to help this poor woman understand the things that overcome her but you simply cant alice has a successful career as an interpreter but her quiet and peaceful life gets brutally interrupted when she wakes up one morning and slowly begins to realize she has absolutely no recollection of the previous three days she finds a torn apart photograph of a hotel located on the holiday island gama and decides to go there in order to investigate what happened on the island several people including a lonely little girl seem to recognize alice only she used the fake name nicole wore a redhaired wig and acted like she came to the island to hide from an unknown danger meanwhile even the poor girls nights are restless as she has reoccurring dreams of astronauts hopping on the moon surface and an uncanny scientist called dr blackman the plot of footprints is truly bizarre and slowly brooding and particularly the cosmic sub plot is really difficult to link with the rest alice assumes they are just images from a scifi movie she saw long time ago which sounds like a reasonable enough explanation but you sense theres a deeper meaning and actual connection to all the other events fans of tensiondriven and stylish italian cinema cant afford themselves to miss this film really this is directors luigi bazzonis psychological tourdeforce with staggeringly beautiful photography and mindaltering music in spite of the lack of violence or maybe just because of it the film is genuinely disturbing and the mental agony alice goes through honestly affects the viewer emotionally as well as it is sadly too often the case in giallicinema the climax suddenly comes rather abrupt and nearly doesnt give a waterproof explanation of all the awkward events you just witnessed for the last hour and a half still the content of footprints will keep you contemplating long after the film has finished and its powerful impact will only increase florinda bolkan is sublime as the tormented leading lady and receives excellent feedback from the limited supportive cast including the young nicoletta elmi the eminent eurocult star klaus kinski receives topbilling as well but his role is merely an extended cameo this film is actually a lot better than director bazzonis more acclaimed and much easier available giallo the fifth cord so heres to hoping footprints will soon receive a fancy dvdrelease as well,0,1
3138,i was completely drawn into the story but i wonder if perhaps i shouldnt have been so sympathetic to the hurt characters plight for respect because when it boils down i really think that glam reporters such as barbara walters is the devil or maybe the filmmakers were telling us that were all unknowing supporters of fluff news stories,0,1
3155,if you are the sort of person looking for a realistic film or one with a strong and believable plot then this film is not for you nopeyoull hate it however for those who like sweet slightly screwball comedies then youll have a nice time watching this slight filmtony randall works for the irs and he investigates a very nice farmer who never realized he needed to file an income tax return however hard he tries to convince them of the seriousness of his visit everyone in the family is thrilled to have company they dote on him and treat him like one of the familyand have plans on getting him hitched to their daughter debbie reynolds thats really about all the plot there is but the film gets high marks for a fun script and decent acting a really nice little curio from the late 1950s,0,1
3178,the main reason to see this film is warren william who is in top form as the shyster campaign manager he is electric constantly finding ways to fool the public and defeat the opposing party in the midst of the biggest disasters william is a great actor i feel he never got his due bette davis as his girlfriend also shines in an underwritten role personally i found guy kibbee not quite right as the lamebrained candidate that william and the others are trying to foist on the public he seemed more like an empty canvas than a person i would have preferred to see a real character emerge rather than a noncharacter the story itself is implausible silly and clichd but warren william and bette davis are well worth watching,0,1

3309,back in the 70s a smalltime texas filmmaker named sf brownrigg directed a handful of surprisingly decent lowbudget drivein horror flicks which seem to have developed a small cult following over the years before viewing his first film dont look in the basement i wasnt too sure what to expect but i sure as hell didnt expect it to turn out to be the only texas horror i thought was better than the chainsaw massacre i dont know this might actually be my alltime favorite horror moviewe begin in an isolated insane asylum at first it seems like a rather laidback place to get mentally healthy considering all the patients are allowed to roam around freely and whatnot as if it were their house i guess it is none of them seem all that dangerous only delusional the residents include a lovenympho a 700 year old woman a manchild a spaz a guy who thinks hes in a war a woman who thinks she has a baby and a guy who thinks hes a judge one day out of nowhere judge kills the doctor with an axe shortly thereafter the wannabe baby mama kills the nurse ten minutes into the movie and things are looking really ugly perhaps the new nurse will know what to do then again perhaps not giving away more would do more harm than good its best to plunge head first into this one knowing as little as possible if you can appreciate honesttogod untampered with horror then you will not be disappointed if you liked scream if you liked wrong turn if you go for that unoriginal overproduced overscored digital hollywood garbage then chances are high you just wont see the beauty in this one dont look in the basement being a first attempt makes the quality all the more shocking the atmosphere and the graininess fit into the location and the score like a glove unfortunately good ol sf used up most of his good ideas on his first movie although the next entry in his texassized quadrilogy is somewhat of a masterpiece that is if youre into extra sleazy meanspirited hixploitation like someone i know if you fall in love with brownriggs first two and absolutely must find out what else he had to offer check out dont open the door and the house where hell froze over dont look in the basement has everything that successful horror needs no stars no budget no digital effects just an original story brought to life in an insane asylum with a dozen cast members and a somber subtle score and of course the twist this is real horror for the real horror fan 1010,0,1

3336,boris karloff and bela lugosi made many films together but on the whole interestingly enough karloff usually is the better man of the two the real exception is the black cat 1934 where karloff is playing the evil head of a devil cult and lugosi is seeking revenge on him for destroying his life but more usual is black friday where whatever his motive karloff is trying to improve brain surgery while lugosi is a murderous thug in the raven lugosi is a sadistic surgeon who blackmails karloff to assist his evil plans until karloff finally has had enough rarely are they both negative characters totally in the body snatcher karloff does kill lugosi but lugosi is trying to blackmail himthe one exception where they are both extremely sympathetic but at cross purposes to each other is this 1936 film which i feel has rarely had the audience acceptance of some of the other movies i have mentioned in it karloffs dr janos rukh is a hard driven scientific genius who has been sneered at by the official scientific community for his theory that a rare form of radium is in nigeria on a meteorite that landed centuries ago he has finally gotten the support of a well financed expedition led by sir francis stevens and his wife lady arabella stevens walter kingsford and beulah bondi and has another scientist a frenchman named dr felix benet lugosi rukhs young wife diane frances drake and a friend and protge of the stevenses named ronald drake frank lawtonbefore they leave rukh is warned by his mother violet kemble cooper that he is possibly seeking wisdom that he shouldnt and it may end in tragedy he tries to dismiss this but he is worried by what she says his scientific standing and whether or not he is going to get his due creditwhat he gets is a disaster he finds the substance but is infected by its remarkable radioactivity he finds that he is slowly burning up and if he tries to touch people or animals they die hes actually built up a friendship or understanding with benet who figures out a type of radioactive fighting cocktail for rukh to use to counter the danger but there are two things that are unbeatable here the antidote can only last for a certain amount of time and has to be replenished and the radioactivity has affected rukhs brain he is increasingly jealous of dianes friendship with ronald encouraged unfortunately by sir francis and lady arabella and he is equally upset that due to his having to pretend to have died the effects of the radioactivity are like that benet and several others are collecting the kudos of the wonders that radium x is giving to man soon rukh is on a murderous rampage that destroys many lives ending with his ownthe film certainly picked up on science to an extent madame curie had died recently from cancer she got due to work with radium few fully understood the dangers of radioactivity in 1936 but some idea of it was coming out the wave of murders by rukh cause the newspapers to talk about a curse on the expedition of course with the idea of a cursed expedition on the continent of africa for a hidden treasure buried centuries ago financed by a titled englishman we have entered archeology not physics or geology paging howard carter and lord carnaevonon the other hand benet tries to settle the cause of the string of deaths and reverts to an idea that was actually demolished in 1888 in england during the whitechapel murders sir charles warren ordered the retinas of several of the dead victims to be photographed to see if the last image on the retinas was jack the ripper it turned out he only got the photographs of the retinas of dead prostitutes but the idea did not die jules verne used it in his novel the brothers kip in 1899 and here dr benet uses it as this is a science fiction story he finds the image of rukh on the the plate but benet drops the plate accidentally and it shattersthe film is good on many grounds the most interesting that for a change karloff and lugosi are not unsympathetic towards each other there is a type of tragic fatalism in this story that is missing from their other films the other performances are good as well in particular ms kemble cooper she is best remembered as basil rathbones frightening sister jane murdstone in david copperfield here her final act is the only way to bring this tragedy to an end and who can say it did not hurt her more than her target,0,1
3351,ok i dont really think that trailer park boys has bad story lines because they kick ass they just conflict with each otherfor example near the end of the movie it shows ricky and julian telling patrick lewis to put the dog down and walk away then at the end it shows ricky and julian saying that theyve been in jail for 2 years in the tv series pilot the first clip they show is the same clip of ricky and julian yelling at patrick lewis but in the tv series theyve supposedly only been in jail for 18 monthsalso they give us the impression that the movies story line and the tv series story line are connected because of the yelling scene between the guys but some actors portray totally different characters of course patrick roach plays patrick lewis in the movie but in the series he plays randy sam tarasco plays one of the guys who pays ricky for an extermination and then he plays sam losco in the seriesalso again i know i have a lot to say in the movie the guys snort coke instead of smoking hash the thing is they never actually confirm that the two story lines are connected in anyway other than the yelling scenesorry to keep on blabbing,0,1
3378,since starting to read the book this movie is based on im having mixed feelings about the filmed result i learned some time ago to see the movie adaptation of a book before i read the book because i found that if i read the book first i was inevitably disappointed in the film this would undoubtedly have been true here whereas in the case of atonement which is probably the best filmed adaptation of a book ive ever seen it would probably not have matteredim trying to figure out what the cause is and i suspect that i have to point my finger squarely at michael cunningham much as i respect him for the hours which i have not read but which i saw and was awed by i cannot escape the feeling that he not so much adapted susan mintons book as he did take a few of the characters and the basic premise and write his own movie out of itits not that i dislike the movie i actually love the movie which is why since i started reading the novel im feeling disturbed about the whole thing i feel disloyal to ms minton for enjoying the movie which was so thooughly a departure from her work reading it i can understand why she had such a struggle adapting it unlike what one reviewer of the movie said its not so much that some novels dont deserve to be a movie its more like some books just cant make the transition ms mintons novel operates on a level so personal and intimate to her central character so internally that it seems impossible to me to place it in a physical realm even though a lot of the book is memory of real events it is memory and so fragmented and ethereal as to be i feel not filmable i think that ms mintons work is a real work of literature but cannot make the transition to film which in no way detracts from its valuei cannot yet report that evening the film does not represent evening the novel in any more than the most superficial way since im only halfway through but the original would have to make a tremendous leap to resemble the film that follows at this point i guess im writing this because i feel that if youre going to adapt a novel adapt it but dont make it something else that its not im not sure if michael cunningham has done anything wholly original but from what i can see so far the things he has done are all based on someone elses work we would not have the hours if virginia woolf had not written mrs dalloway and we would not have evening in its distressed form if susan minton had not had so much trouble doing what probably should not have been attempted in the first place but its too much to say that it would be better if ms minton had left well enough alone because evening the film is a satisfactory and beautiful work of its ownthus my confusion mixed feelings sense of disloyalty and ultimate conclusion that in this case the novel cannot be the film and vice versa and my eventual gratitude to both writers for doing what they did so that we have both works as they are,0,1

3426,when i first saw the title i was already deducing the theme of the film it clearly wasnt a reference to british currency so it had to be shakespearian and about pounds of flesh taking them or giving them will smiths a feelgood actor so serial killers were out it could only be about a man giving them so must be about guilt somehow i spoilt the whole thing for myself by looking it up and knowing the story before i watched as the beauty of the buildup is the way parts of the main characters background are drip fed to slowly illuminate the audience as to who he is and why he is doing what he is doingguilt is a very hard subject to do simply because its deeply uncomfortable and sad which is not an encouraging premise when you are hoping for a rollercoaster ride you know its going to be unpleasant i wouldnt say the movie glorifies suicide it delves into the most extreme form of selfsacrifice martyrdomits also brimming with symbolism everywhere which is a surefire telltale sign that the writing is cleverly thought out in great detail and driving at multiple meanings and a deep reflective nature the most prominent theme that struck me was that he was not only giving his heart to the girl he loves emotionally and metaphorically but was giving it to her physically as the greatest gift he could determined to die but his plan is thwarted by falling in love what a 2nd act complication absolutely masterfulyes it is very slowpaced but im undecided as to whether it would have been better slotted into a smaller timeframe i didnt feel the strain and his terrible inner turmoil as much as i could have but maybe thats just me having ruined it for myself beforehand saying all that though it is a deeply moving and original film that is an incredibly powerful and thoughtprovoking tragedy that deserves the awards it will inevitably get,0,1

3457,countless tv displays and the memorable appearances from 4 of todays megastarsplus hope daviss screen debut keep flatliners still in prudence the plot is about a nonacademic research of five medicine undergrads pursuing ones crazy idea on discovering the secret of death and learn whats after death then come back to life again yet the storyline hasnt been designed as fascinating as the idea of the plotthere are popular stereotypes to develop a regular teenslasher script in flatliners there is nelson who creates the idea of decoding death pretty but introverted rachel david who cuts the gordian knot on luckily not to be dismissed from the school ladies man joe and finally the smart guy randyi did not come to medical school to murder my class mates no matter how deranged they might be they join hands altogether in an experiment where nelsons heart will be stopped and rerythmed then they decide to continue this experiment in strict confidence at night times in the campus not long after nelsons experience everyone starts a race over having the wildest and the longest death experience risking their lives one by one yet soon they realize their daily life becomes affected from those experiences they had the visits to the afterlife brings back their delinquent feelings from their childhood memories depolarizing their deep subconscious watchfulness they begin having somatic delusions and visual hallucinationswhen the point comes where the explanation of subconscious director joel schumacher skips that every humankind has a subconscious personality which they are not aware of this inner personality keeps one from altering into identity loss if you lose or if you depolarize this subconscious personality you certainly lose your identity instead of refreshing childhood memories i wanted to add this as a movie mistake which already has been mentioned via movie critics in the earlier 90s obviously here in this movie schumacher made the actors have it least affected then why do they hesitate continuing on the experiment after learning their lesson as if death is designed indiscoverable by god david had been introduced as an atheist now he turned out to believe in god when he recalled a flashback from his childhood after witnessing this 180 degreed change in david its clear to see that schumachers film was so conservative and lilylivered thats ultimately why its never classified as a work of science fiction alas it had a good potential it even tried to tell the unconscious maturation from having a death experience beginning to believe that death is so simply natural and its only a part of a humans lifemore than whats in the movie it was also memorable to recall whats with the movie jan de bont as the cinematographer who had worked almost every time with schumacher creates an dreamy atmosphere like its being an gothic horror movie the blue color schemes all over the walls reflecting into the actors faces deliver first class of lighting that suits perfectly with the film the closeup shots of the gargoyle statues in the campus buildings catholic frescoes in the walls stopmotion cameras and the dynamic camera speeds were all belong to bonts skillsflatliners became a cult movie in time with its sociological penportrait of the xgeneration juvenile especially via its futuristic editing style with storyboard connection sequences like being part of a video music clip so much aesthetically those were the times where fastpaced and multisequenced video music clips were on rise this style was very rare to come across in those years after its pioneer tony scotts the hunger1983,0,1

3486,spoilers hereinwhat really scares you killer sharks or maybe ghosts trying to bring back a message maybe a chainsaw wielding psychopathmaybe but those fears dont even compare to a horror which people dare not even speak of or considerand that is the death of ones own child pet sematary taps this base primal adult fear and then takes it to places that most could not bear to exploreive read comments about this film that include poor acting characters making stupid decisions etc i disagree the acting is actually first rate for a film like this maybe it is impossible for many to imagine the desperation resulting from such a scenario but the films events are not only logical they may be absolutely inevitable if such a scenario were possible this is the true horror of pet sematary it isnt that pets and people come back from the dead as evil killers who hunt with knives and scalpels it is that anyone who has lost a child could become so desperate as to commit the crimes that louis creed does despite warning or even past historythe movie takes those willing to go with it to the depths of a desperate human heart the heart of a protector trying to make up for not being able to protect and the results are horrifying in fact when the film dives into slasher territory near the end its almost a letdown although i believe its perfectly logical how it got therei am a true horror fan and i contend that this is one of the scariest horror films ever made if you dont think so see it again after you have children,0,1
3515,now im a bit biased since im a big fan of late night television ive been a loyal fan of jay leno for about 6 or 7 years and think hes one of the funniest most talented comedians out there and david letterman is one hell of a comedian as well though i only watch his show unless jays a repeat during commercials or when he has a better guest than jay on the show daniel roebuck and john michael higgins are both fine actors and they very much resembled jay and dave but did they disappear into the characters nope roebuck barely nails down jays voice and expression mumbling at a high pitch sounding like a castrati marlon brando higgins nails down davids facial expressions for example his trademark squirm but he doesnt nail down daves voice those who arent big fans of late night tv might be a lot less biased theres a couple comedians who can do deadon impersonations of jay why couldnt they have selected one of them for the part and the same goes with dave id rather they had norm mcdonald play the part norm doesnt look a hell of a lot like dave but he did a great impersonation of him on snl heyyou got any gum that was so hilarioushowever i learned a lot about the late night wars which i had very little knowledge of at first i never watched the tonight show prior to when jay leno was host so i didnt know about the struggle to finally replace johnny carson and the countless negotiations that finally convinced dave to move to cbs i knew very little about what happened behind the scenes and found the film very enlightening and kathy bates gives a knockout performance as the foulmouthed former executive producer of the tonight show she basically steals the film my score 7 out of 10,0,1
3538,that this film flopped at the box office and still struggles for the recognition it deserves today is a great pity yet somehow rather appropriate the commercial suicide the monkees committed by making this film is mirrored by the metaphorical suicide they commit onscreen to destroy so brutally their carefully constructed image as a wholesome american alternative to the beatles is courageous to the point of rashness as is the admission of being no more than pawns in the entertainment industry trapped in the movie literally in their own artificiality the monkees television series was not that conventional but head is utterly plotlessalthough in the end there is actually some kind of circular logic to it all unrestrained by a genuine storyline the surreal sequence of events is by turns hilarious and rather disturbing the greatest irony is that the monkees effectively signed their death warrant as a commercial force at a time when they were reaching their artistic peak their exploration into psychedelia reached its zenith with the soundtrack to head all the songs are memorably woven into the film which is one of the landmarks albums of the sixties the monkees began to disintegrate after the box office failure of this movie but head serves as a noble legacy,0,1

3645,a friend of mine asked doesnt one have to be proeuthanasia in order to like this movie is it a mistake of the movie to infer most quadriplegics want to end their lives interesting questionsas far as i can see correct me if im wrong there is only one quadriplegic who wanted to end his life in the sea inside think ramn sampedro addressed this in the movie as well it is he who wants to die it is he who is fighting for his right to decide his death he is speaking for himself and not other quadriplegics though his pioneering work depending on ones perspective may prove beneficial or damaging to quadriplegics down the road his primary objective is a personal one but one thing this movie does my opinion anyway is that it forces us the viewers to ask ourselves the inferring questions my friend so succinctly put forthafter my first viewing of the sea inside i walked home in a conflicted blur i struggled to reconcile with this exasperating notion why would ramn want to die given the love care and sacrifices so unconditionally showered on ramn by the people surrounding him why would he doggedly cling on to his hurtful decision then on my second viewing a shared thought between ramn and the lawyer lady entered my consciousness it threw up a telling observation total dependency comes at the expense of intimacy most human beings crave for such an intimacy of course how much we value such needs depends largely on the individualas a person with a familialbiased sensibility i empathised strongly with the caregivers in this movie why cant javier consider the sacrifice and the love from his family and friends is he blind to it all i would think not the miracle of the sea inside therefore is its insightful depiction of a very humanistic tug of war when we are faced with the guardianship of a sane but incapacitated loved one whom has expressed a calm conscious and rational intent to die what then is the right thing to do is caring for and keeping this loved one alive against his or her will a pious gesture does it show up the worth of our love or does it merely soothe our selfish fears of irreplaceable loss with so much understanding accorded to caregivers wouldnt their invalid charges by submitting themselves to the total dependency of others for survival also be an overlooked act of sacrifice rhetorical or not how much is dignity worth to an individual is living or dying with dignity a privilege or a right if we really care and love a person should we also respect their eventual decisions in life as in death a torrent of questions the movie might have asked answers to which im in no position to providein our eagerness to intellectually demarcate the merits of prolife or prochoice we run the risk of ignoring a sea of grey thats engulfing the people most intimately affected the caregivers and the ones they care for the sea inside hence attempted to present the delicate yet complex relationship dynamics between them intuitively this film understands one thing that the nature of sacrifice is never onesided in this tug of war we should endeavour not to win arguments but to intently observe and hopefully determine who is the stronger party to make that sacrificethe sea inside is a sobering film it opened my eyes to things i dont wanna see and for that i am grateful,0,1

3691,well i guess i was in the mood for a movie that really grabbed me from the beginning this movie wasnt it it plodded along at a pretty slow deliberate pace for the first 40 minutes but there wasnt really anything in it that i was terribly interested intheres an intriguing and mysterious feud between jean renos character and an old man but more of the first 40 minutes is dominated by the wanderings of the main character whom i didnt know much about and couldnt really relate to at the time he wanders around alone for the most part he doesnt meet anyone i imagine the director was trying to depict the loneliness of the human condition in this postapocalyptic world or something which is all good but i still wish hed trimmed it down from 40 minutes to 15 because it can get incredibly boringbut after those 40 minutes things start to get very interesting i guess i wont really say more than that because i dont want to spoil anything so if youve seen the first 1530 minutes of this movie and are thinking about turning it off like i was just stick with itit gets a lot betterone of the most interesting things i found about this movie was the fact that it had no dialogue whatsoever which really made me have to think about what was happening how characters were feeling and what their motivations were why things were how they were in this postapocalyptic world all of which gives the story a lot of room for audience interpretation and its amazing how much more satisfying a movie is when the actors arent telling you exactly whats going on,0,1

3767,when alfred hitchcock made strangers on a train it was a harbinger for the bulk of the film going public that he was back at the top of his form from 1946 to 1950 his films were not box office successes and his contractual arrangement with david o selznick ended because of this actually he made some really good films in the period such as notorious spellbound under capricorn rope and my opinion stagestruck but while notorious and spellbound were liked the audiences were turned off by hitchs attempts at experimentation his use of a dream sequence by salvator dali in spellbound was acceptable as was the setting among psychiatrists but the experiment with long takes in rope confused the public making ignore the merits of that film and the willingness of hitch to have the audience fooled by a lie told by a leading character in a flashback was disliked far more disliked then it deserved to be in stagestruck a matter of bad timing for under capricorn it was released just as the scandal of its star ingrid bergman and roberto rosallini broke out made it seem to be a failure which it wasnt the paradine case was another failure and one that really had little in its favorwith strangers on a train hitchcock shied away from the special tricks that interested him in the recent films instead he concentrated on his favorite themes of shared guilt and mistaken identity based on a novel by patricia highsmith the story was of how guy haines a professional tennis player meets a fan of his bruno anthony a playboy who is traveling on a crosscountry train at the same time as the athlete bruno is talkative and fawning and guy views him as one of the typical fans he has metif a little eccentric with his talk of wanting to be on the first rocket to outer space but bruno knows all about guys personal problems he is married to a promiscuous young woman named miriam and is in love with anne morton daughter of a senator bruno knows that miriam wont divorce her successful celebrity husband bruno mentions how he can sympathize he hates his stepfather who is constantly criticizing him then bruno mentions sort of off the cuff an idea he has about two men technically strangers exchanging murders for each other and then committing two perfect unsolvable crimes instead of fumbling them guy listens to the idea and agrees it is an interesting idea the train reaches guys destination and his last comment is like a validation of the idea he just does not realize that the eccentric bruno is a sociopath and believes guy has just agreed to the two killing each others foeits a wonderfully simple plot actually bruno of course does kill miriam but he fully expects guy to live up to the murder agreement and kill his stepfather guy is horrified and worse he finds that he is the police departments number one suspect when bruno to encourage guy mentions he has the latters lighter he pocketed it on the train and can plant it at the murder site guy finds himself in deeper problems how to avoid the police and how to control if possible the insane brunohitch always planned the shots of his film carefully so that from the start we see both our heroes from their feet heading towards their fateful meeting in the train with each other there are constant crosscontacts used in the film to show how the two men are drawn into each others orbits it is like fate drawing them together yet both have their own personality and hitch with a typical twist makes the mad bruno actually more of an attractive figure his scheme may be vicious it will kill two people if successful and he will have guy live up to the agreement no matter what but he has a zest for life one suspects that once guy too had one but his marriages failure coupled with his now dating a socially prominent woman has made him more circumspect and dull than he wasthe cast is good too robert walker probably had his finest role in this film only a year before his death it was a far cry from the homespun boynextdoor of since you went away or the clock his lithe figure also looked quite elegant in tales in several scenes as guy farley granger acts like a cousin of his comurderer in rope especially as the circumstances make him increasingly suspicious to the authorities as his earlier role made his jittery behavior increasingly suspicion to jimmy stewart as for the ladies kasie rogers is properly sluttish as miriam enabling the audience to be prepared for her demise in a famous sequence shot in the reflection of her eyeglasses so that they actually are cheering bruno in his act of evil patricia hitchcock appears as the younger sister of anne ruth roman who bears a close resemblance to miriam and accidentally sets off bruno at a social occasion she plays this rare role well ruth roman is properly supportive of granger but her role is limiting because she is establishment in her background and somewhat low keyed other supporting performers leo g caroll as the senator marion lorne usually a comedian as brunos dotty mother and norma varden as an unexpected recipient of violence from walker are all shown to best advantage all at the hand of a master,0,1
3773,the incredible melting man is a fantastically gross trashy and energetic zgrade production that every selfrespecting camphorror freak simply has to see for himherself the ideal way to describe this lowbudget 70s gem is like a shameless copy of hammers the quatermass xperiment only a thousand times filthier astronaust steve west is the only survivor of a disastrous spacemission but turns out the carrier of a horrible disease that makes him radioactive and causes him to melt in shock after seeing his face in the mirror can you blame him steve busts out of the hospital leaving a trail of sticky pus and fallen off body parts behind doctor ted nelson has to find him urgently as the disease also set steve up with an insatiable appetite for human flesh the premise may sound utterly stupid but this flick is enormously entertaining and contains great makeup effects from the hand of rick baker the melting dudes face looks like a rotting pizza and his heavy breathing makes him sound like darth vader another big advantage is that william sachs screenplay doesnt waste any time on tedious scientific explanations or emotional speeches the repulsiveness starts right away and lasts until the very last moment of the film just enjoy this silly horror gem and try to switch off your brain activity as much as you can because if you start contemplating about the many stupidities in the script youll miss out on all the campy fun,0,1
3777,david cronenberg movies are easily identifiable or at least elements within the movie stand out as his trademarks fetishism the blurring between the organic and inorganic squishy throbbing things that shouldnt be squishy and throbbing existenz is classic cronenberg briefly its about a future generation of computer games but instead of a video monitor visuals are supplied by your mind the game plugs directly into a bio port in the base of your spine and while the game is running the player cant tell reality from game jennifer jason leigh plays the games developer guiding a novitiate marketeer jude law through the games paces while in the game they uncover strange goingson and possible crimes but are they real or is it the game not even the games author knows the movie is quite a treat keeping the viewer engaged but in the dark until the final minutes another thing i like about existenz is that it doesnt use a heavy reliance on special effects its the story itself that propels the movie recommended for the saturday night when science fiction is called for,0,1

3919,we saw the silent version of this film and it is quite simply shimmeringly beautiful its quite hard to see how a sound version could have been created since it is shot with pure silent technique long wordless sweeps of narrative without a single intertitle save for a few disconcerting sequences where louise brooks playing a french typist is quite visibly speaking in english the only section that obviously cries out for sound is the final scene where brooks is watching the rushes for her test for a sound film footage which plays constantly in the background as the action unfolds with her mouth moving in ceaseless soundless song i was unsurprised to learn afterwards that this passage alone in the talkie version had been hailed as an exemplar of new technique in the sunny beauty of its opening scenes and the fairytale inevitability of what follows the film resembles a dream as a louise brooks movie it was not at all what i was expecting either from her hollywood comedies or from gwpabsts german melodramas i found the idiom more fluent and enjoyable than either and brooks herself is a different creature a sturdy laughing young animal rather than a shopwindow vamp or manipulated dollbut what gives this film greater depth than at first appears is the unexpected second half repelled by the rich parasites who cluster around her beauty the pauper princess returns to a tearstained reunion with her humblyborn true love and the tale might very well have been ended there fairytale however turns to tragedy the dilettante grabovsky confident in his ability to manipulate the woman he desires is yet all too correct in his selfinterested prediction the young lovers cannot make each other happy and andr ironically was right to mistrust the social influence of beauty contests after the intoxication of her moments glory lucienne frets herself to despair over the humdrum routine of married life while her husband in turn is driven wild by any reminder of the whole affair if it were a simple case of a mismatched marriage that would be one thing but the true tragedy is that they do love each otherin many ways prix de beaut reminds me of murnaus sunrise but if so the fairground and photographer scenes here would form a distorted mirrorimage of the joyous reconciliation in sunrise no dream but an alienating nightmare and the following dawn brings not a miraculous reunion but an empty bed and deserted home leaving a letter to say that she loves him and will always love him lucienne vanishes again from andrs life in quest of brightness and freedom and this time she will never come backgossip columns confirm all andrs worst convictions as he learns of his wifes whereabouts through reports coupling her name with grabovsky when the young workman penetrates at last to the lavish sanctum of the screeningroom it is with drawn gun to be greeted by the sight of his rival courting and caressing a laughing lucienne the same woman who had pledged her undying affection as she left him he kills her but even as he kills is transfixed by the living image on screen lucienne in all her transformed glory as he never saw her the two women are juxtaposed in an endless powerful moment as andr is seen seized unresisting and pulled away the dying girl and her singing self still projected above caught unknowing out of time into celluloid eternity playing on unconscious of life or death or love beneath herthe main jarring element in the film is the character of andrs coworker antonin who appears to serve no role throughout other than to be the licensed butt of his contemporaries malice he is the ugly one who can never get the girl the ungainly wimp who is tripped and tormented in the washrooms and at work and must take it all with an uncertain ingratiating smile in his fruitless hope for social acceptance a typical product of the bullying of the more gifted and popular in other words but one the audience is apparently being invited to laugh at along with his tormentors unless the intention is to expose a darker side to the protagonists for which i perceive no sign the character seems to exist merely as comic relief but comic relief with a distinctly nasty edge when we know him only as an inept peeping tom at the waterside its easy to laugh although the others revenge seems a little over the top when we discover that he is no chancemet stranger but andrs colleague and regular sidekick the continuing attacks rapidly cease to be very funnybut it is the images that remain beauty nightmare and dream,0,1
3927,great little thriller i was expecting some type of silly horror movie but what i got was tight short thriller that waste none of our time mostof these movies we have to get into the back characters stories so we will either feel sympathy for them or hatred when people start getting killed o such foolishness here yes you see a few characters but they really only interact with the principals such as the husband wife at the motel whose room was canceled we saw them so we could just how efficient the lisa character was and how inefficient the new hotel clerk was we see the little girl simply because she will have a very small but important role later in the movie when all heck breaks loose the flight atrendants because we need on in particular to move the plot ahead the bad guy in particular needs her in the beginning of the flight the rude guy in the airport was important to the movie too the only 2 characters that were just 5 liners with no use to the plot were the two young guys on the plane that was clever because i thought they would have something to do with plot from the first scene to the last the woman character a young hotel executive named lisa is in charge even when jackson shows his true colors she doesnt panic she thinks what she can do to stall time any other movie the smart executive women would be acting like idiots but not this one it was a very short movie and i was waiting for the usual plot devices to kick in because the movie seemed to be coming to its conclusion fast thankfuly none of them were used the new hotel clerk did not do the usual called and told her what to do which is panic drop the phone and run out of the hotel without saying anything or question your boss and tell her she had to much to drink and just dismiss her was craven should do more of these types of movies also one last comment brian cox is in the movie but i had not one clue who he was i had to come over here to see that he is lisas father he is completely unrecognizable,0,1
3928,calling this a romantic comedy is accurate but nowadays misleading the genre has sadly deteriorated into cliches too focused on making the main couple get together and with very little room for ambience and other stories making it formulaic and overly predictablethe shop around the corner does not suffer from these illnesses it manages to create a recognisably middleeasterneuropean atmosphere and has a strong cast besides the also strong nominal leads i avoid using the words supporting cast as for example mr matuschek frank morgan has a central role to the film and his story is equally if not more important than the romancethe 1998 film youve got mail borrowed the anonymous penpal idea from this film and has therefore been billed as a remake this is not correct and in fact unfair to the new movie it shares the genre and borrows a plot element but that is all,0,1

3971,michael stearns plays mike a sexually frustrated individual with an interesting moral attitude towards sexuality he has no problem ogling naked dancers but when women start having sex with men thats when he loses it he believes that when women actually have sex thats when they lose any sense of innocence andor beauty so he strolls through the hollywood hills stalking lovemaking couples at a distance ultimately shooting the men dead with a highpowered rifle with a scopethe seeming primary reason for this movies existence is to indulge in sexual activity over and over again the story comes off as more of an afterthought this is bound to make many a happily heterosexual male quite pleased as were treated to enough protracted scenes of nudity the ladies here look awfully good sans clothes and sex to serve as a major dose of titillation of course seeing a fair deal of it through a scope ups the creepiness factor considerably and illustrates the compulsion towards voyeurism for one thing mike eyes the couples through the scope for minutes at a time before finally pulling the trigger this is all underscored by awfully intrusive if somewhat atmospheric music on the soundtrackthose with a penchant for lurid trash are bound to enjoy this to one degree or another it even includes one lesbian tryst that confounds mike and renders him uncertain how to react it unfolds at a very slow pace but wraps up with a most amusing ironic twist its a kinky and twisted rarity that if nothing else is going to definitely keep some viewers glued to the screen710,0,1

4011,ive bought the feast of all saints and its not truly a horrible movie but a lot of things could have been better it had a lot of historical value played out by very talented actressactors and its not an everyday occurrence that actors can play out such a role and have it be somewhat believable there were some parts that were a little mediocre and confusing but i wouldnt say that the entire movie was horrible once you think about that capturing 1800s new orleans and making something out of it it pretty hard and much harder to get actors who can strongly signify those parts but the only big problem i had with the movie was that most of the actors who did play the free people of color were mostly light skinned africans not very universal in casting others who werent light skinned one of the old creole stereotypes that still exists whomever did the casting could have picked a wider variety when it came to hue despite many creoles are color consciousrather picking actors that looked near white in a sense could have been more thought outthe actors did a great job the script could have better written and overall i found the performances were very believable,0,1
4048,all those that identify this as a simple ripoff of elephant are there no other comments that you can make towards the movie on its own merits as an individual film regardless of its apparent similarities to other moviesall those that question the validity of the movie in terms of its stereotypical characters the obligatory gay the jock the disabled kid etc im not sure how long it has been since you were at school but regardless of how amateurish the acting may be the happenings that go one are surprisingly close to what may actually happenand all those that disregard the film as being so simple just six teenagers with the regular teenage angst that pushes one over the edge did anyone stop to think and take notice that the girl who took her life wasnt actually one of those six as one comment points out she had screen time of maybe 2min max excluding the final scenes i think the point of the film is not only to make an issue of teenage angst and how far it can take someone but also that it is no apparently obvious who is always in danger of committing such an act suicide,0,1

4102,the movie although not faithful to the original novels succeeds in creating modern gothic vampire vision somebody tried to insult qotd calling it a 15h music video clip actually it is a complement the everpresent gothic music combined with the musicvideolike shots made the movie so moody and queen of the damned is a mooddriven storyi do not understand the die hard fans who complain on the modifications of the story the plot has been modified to be less confusing for viewers who do not know the novels the number of characters had been lessened and i have no problems with changing lestats maker or skipping mekares character the biggest change the romance of lestat and jesse seemed a very nice addition to meactually i think that a faithful adaptation would be a complete failure the slow and gloomy mood that was perfect to xixth century new orlean and louiss angst wouldnt fit lestats rebellion and his music and while the book can be slow descriptive and combining multiple elements yet conveying them well the movie simply cannot do it without turning chaotic vampire lestat and queen of the damned can be split into at least three movies the creators had to choose somethingsome of the special effects like the flying or walking out of the flames were the only thing i actually didnt like in this movie but akashas death was very nice the cast was good stuard townsend was convincing as lestat especially on the concert but i preferred banderas as armand i loved jesse maharet and marius though and of course aaliyah was perfect with her quasiancientegyptian accentso if you are into gothic music and vampiric dillemas of loneliness and eternity and you dont consider books to be movie scenarios queen of the damned is one of the few movies which show vampires as something more than blood sucking monsters but please do not compare it to the interview movie it has a completely different style precisely as much different as different were louis and lestat personally i find it thrilling first to watch a vampires existence from louis bottled hunger point of view and then switching to one devoid of all morals but surprisingly outgoing for a vampire lestatid give queen 8 of 10 as it had some technical flaws but i decided to give it 9 as its vastly underrated by people who hate it simply because it didnt match their vision of the books which can be clearly seen by looking at the votes breakdown,0,1
4107,this video was my first introduction to the residents and i couldnt stop playing it for the past three days the visuals are dynamite and more inventive and technically complex than any i have ever seen on the big screen or smallthe dvd loses points however for the pointless addition of new music the original residents music is unlike anything else youve ever heard and will really tweak your brain in the best possible way the new music however is uniformly uninteresting and in most cases is rather bad in comparison to some of the classic tracks also the uncompleted vileness fats video feels very incomplete and i could only fathom the plot of the story from extensive reading of the notes on the discspeaking of notes on the disc this dvd features lots of cool easter eggs that will probably appeal to longtime fans of the residents hint look for icons on the notes pages that shouldnt be therefrom a technical standpoint the disc is one of the best dvd transfers available there is virtually no observable pixelization and only a little edginess in strong contrast pointskudos for a top notch presentation this disc really deserves your attention,0,1
4118,i went into the straight story expecting a sadhappy type drama with nice direction and some good acting these i got what i wasnt expecting was an allegory for the trials of human existence leave it to lynch to take a simple story about a 300 mile trip on a lawnmower and turn it into a microcosm for the human conditionif you didnt notice watch it again paying attention to the ages of the people alvin meets the terrain hes driving through the reactions people give him the kinds of discussions he has one of the first is about pregnancy and children one of the last is outside of a cemetery the last road he drives down is particulary haunting in this context as it narrows and his fear and nervousness mount the last mechanical failure could be seen as a death and the miraculous rebirth of his engine relating to an afterlife in which he achieves the desired reunioni only hope some of the people who branded this as a slow sappy melodrama take the time to watch with a more holistic attention,0,1
4137,the journey of hope 1990 is about a trek that many nomadic and poor turks make so they could live the good life in switzerland these people are so desperate to live like westerners that theyll give up their life and lives in an attempt to reach the promised land so many of them are swindled by greedy crooks who make their living off of charging huge fees for desperate people who are in a no win situation one family braves the cold the treacherous mountain range and predatory criminals only to discover that theres not always a shining white light at the end of the tunnel this problem exists world wide not just in america some people tend to forget that a heart breaker of a film thatll leave you wondering why at the endhighly recommended,0,1
4157,hrmi think that line was from the old movie postersthis is a dumb movie that seems to have been translated from some language that was totally unfamiliar to the translator heres a tip any movie that starts with a black screen and text reading in the future is going to be fun this means that the premise is so implausible that they have to explain it to youin this case in the future means that instead of fighting wars nations have guys climb into giant robots and duke it out to determine well thats never terribly clear but its probably something really important there are good guys obviously capitalists ie us and bad guys commies and there are big stopmotion robotssadly the effects budget was pretty slim so we dont get to see a lot of the big robots there are plenty of cheap looking interior scenes and then a big space fight near the end the space fight is especially nice as it serves precisely no purpose other than the blow the remainder of the effects budgetwith said money now spent the climactic fight degenerates into and im not making this up two guys hitting each other with sticks i can always get a laugh in a bar by reenacting the final scene complete with a last line guaranteed to leave any audience scratching their headslike i saidits dumb thats why i bought the tape,0,1
4175,star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning a notably bad actor getting by on his now fading looks rather than any strong dramatic talent richard gere has always occupied a rather curious position in the american hollywood scene always a sure bet in leading man roles who still holds a notable presence today but nowadays he seems to have settled more into these sort of direct to dvdlimited release roles and as such maybe seems to be more settled in his forte nowhe has to draw on some stern matter here as hardened cynical case worker earl babbage one such worker assigned to a few hundred sex offenders in one area of the us who along with his new protg allison allthrop claire danes must take to his latest case delving into the abduction of a young woman while trying to forgive himself for a case he failed on ages agothis is a certain dive into the darker side of humanity treading on material definitely not for the squeamish or those looking for light viewing and as such its a pretty strong compelling film unflinching and not constrained by its direct to dvd budget the only thing really pulling it back is the overly used jittery fast cutting camera sequences used in the more dramatic moments that look a bit corny after a while but its still some of the solidest material ive seen gere in relentlessly getting darker and more over the edge as it goes on,0,1
4189,the merchant of four seasons is a film about a lack of love the film starts off with the main character hans epp returning from a spell in the foreign legion he returns to his mother not to be told how much she loves him or how much shes missed him but to be told that he is worthless and even worse that she would have preferred the man he went with to have come back instead it is the characters relation to women that makes this film so hateful the fact that his wife is taller than him is symbolic of his relation to the other gender he is consistently humiliated by them and it is through his relations with them that his life isnt as great as it could have been this is also shown clearly by the way he treats his wife after a drink he lost his job as a policeman through lust for a woman and even his wife a woman that is supposed to love him never really shows any affection for him even at the end his wife is more bothered about what her and her daughter will do than the state of her husbandthe merchant of four seasons is a thoroughly unpleasant film there isnt a scene in the movie where someone is happy and not only that but the movie seems deliriously blissful to wallow in the misery of its central characters the movie is certainly not recommended to anyone who is currently having a hard time thats for sure despite all the misery the film never steps out the bounds of reality every event in this movie can and most probably has happened and that only serves in making the movie more shocking the film is of course helmed by rainer werner fassbinder the cult german director that committed suicide in 1982 this is only my second taste of the mans work but through just two films it is easy to get an idea of the type of art that he creates both films are downtrodden and gritty yet realistic pieces of art his characterization in this movie is subtle we only ever get to know the characters through their plights and not through their character this is a very clever way of showing the audience that it is their surroundings that define the people in the film not the people themselves and as nearly everyone that sees the film knows what living in an urban society is like it wont difficult for the majority of people to relate to the merchant of four seasons is not a film that is easily forgettable the movie is high on substance and low on style and that makes for a very memorable picture and one that everyone who considers themselves to be a fan of cinema should experience it is with that in my mind that i give this film my highest recommendations its not sweet and its not pleasant but you will not see a more realistic portrayal of depression and this is most certainly a movie that will stay with you,0,1
4192,the movie starts out with three people on a play it by ear holiday who decide to first visit a crocodile farm and then go on to a little lighter activity a fishing touryou pick up some interesting information about crocodiles during their visit to the farm and the information adds just enough to increase the suspense later during the movie as you recall what was told earlier onthe action in the movie is well timed and not over done suspense is built through the what ifs the unknown and the sometimes gut wrenching decisions the characters make in the moviei found myself wondering what i would do if i was in the same boat no pun intendedthe film quality was really good and the effects where realistic believable and not over the top or cartoon looking and out of place the way you sometimes get with cgias a horror movie buff i watch just about every horror movie i can get my hands on in just about every genre and this is one of the best crocodile horror movies if not the best i have seenwatch this movie and you will not be disappointed,0,1
4205,without kirsten miller this project neednt have been completed however with the awe inspiring beauty and talent that is miss miller i would definitely recommend it it looked as if the other actors were only playing to her strong performance wagners dismal attempt to honor this film was a bit disappointing but his few scenes didnt detract from being entertained mostly my criticisms are with the writing and plot line the group of talent assembled did a heroic job of salvaging what should have been a disaster the charismatic miller delivery and timing were impeccable and believable she plays that fine line between assertive and bossy but never offensive she is in fact the structural engineer she claims to be i wish i had seen this on the big screen but alas i was fortunate to rent it before it was lost,0,1
4233,five years after she teamed up with james cagney in the public enemy mae clarke makes another appearance this time as his fiance with cagneys character on the other side of the law it seems like she was calling more of the shots in their relationship as well trying to get johnny cave to be a little more practical with his money and his career you had to figure theyd get back together after she gave him the boot for challenging her crooked boss those things have a way of working out in picturesi got a kick out of watching cagney in this one i usually do and here he looked like he might have auditioned that characteristic shoulder shrug move that he used to good effect in angels with dirty faces portraying rocky sullivan it was right after he threw cavanaugh robert gleckler out of his office during the first attempt at bribing the new weights and measures boss he turns to the camera and hitches up as if entirely pleased with his response to the crook very coolits my understanding that this wasnt one of cagneys warner films but it might as well have been warners often took up the cause for the common man and the expose of crooked merchants and the politicians who protected them would have been right up their alley you also have those great new york city street scenes depicting cars and shops of the era with home made signs pricing flour at eighteen cents a pound hey how about the furniture store selling the living room set for a hundred eighty nine dollars you might get a single stick chair for that price todaybest part of the picture just might be that meat counter scene when cagney james burke aloysius and the butchers play catch with an underweight chicken one of the films lighter moments but you get an idea how tense people can get when theyre caught cheating same with the truck driver whos pressured by johnny into signing for an accurate delivery he just wasnt used to doing thatall in all a nice diversion from cagneys more typical gangster presence even if not up to the standard of his feature films its easy enough to obtain as one of a handful of public domain cagney pictures out there and often found in relatively inexpensive compilations,0,1
4270,the men can slaver over lollo if they like or her lollosshe gave her name to a slang terms for breasts in french but the ladies have an even tastier morsel in the divine gerard philipe who is not only beautiful but can act dont be deterred if your version has no subtitles because in this simple dashing story of love and war in which all is fair they are not needed all you need know is that at the beginning of the film lollobrigida reads philipes palm and tells him he will marry the daughter of the king thereafter the story is quite plain from the gallic gestures and the running jumping and swordplayon the minus side the obviousness of the story and the heavyhanded facetiousness of the tone become somewhat wearying and it is annoying that the french apparently consider themselves too superior to hollywood to bother even attempting the plausibility of its exciting stunts and of course the nonfrenchspeaker misses the occasional bit of oohlala such as virtuous girl i must tell you that my heart belongs to fanfan seducer my dear what made you think i was interested in that bagatelle,0,1
4307,the movie looked like a walkthrough for immoral study most likely i never got much involved with the burning need of the female artist to immortalize male nudes and thus all that fuss about now who drew this penis sounded a bit gratuitous dialogues in this movie are rather dreadful albeit visually this movie got its moments i almost dig it when tassi got into painting a mental picture but then movie weered back onto penises highly recommended to those who has not seen one in a while,0,1
4380,every american who thinks he or she understands world war two should see this movie few hollywood films about the war have defied the stereotype of japanese soldiers as emotionless brutes obeying orders without thinking we like to think that every japanese man was ready and able to fight to the death right up to the day we bombed nagasaki fires on the plain shows a different reality troops pathetically undersupplied demoralized and starved to the point of cannibalism they euphemistically refer to human flesh as monkey meat the movie and novel on which it was based also put to death the myth that japanese soldiers all preferred death to surrender they had good reason to believe that their enemies were in no mood to take prisoners to me it raises a question most americans would rather avoid if the japanese military was so beaten down at this point in the war why was it necessary to nuke hiroshima,0,1
4411,this movie is a piece of the time in which it was made realistic movies were not candy coated during the late 60s and early 70s the producers did not try to create some happy ending that didnt exist the lack of a happy ending would create agitation in the audience that hopefully would spur them on to action at least thats how it seemed at the time in todays movie world this movie would probably not be done there would definitely not be this ending however realistic the sad fact is that the movie depicted a situation which could not be improved upon without action from the improvement of the relationship between the white southern traditional thinking and the progressive movements of that time,0,1
4426,why did i vote 1010 for this movie that is just completely off guts quite simply because if you just let yourself find it funny you can just laugh until you choke some people might find that it goes too far it is certainly not for everyone but whenever im down and just need something really really stupid to laugh at chuck on bottom or ghp and i can forget all of my troubles and be transported into a magical dark and weird worldcompletely off guts is an australian expression it has no literal translation,0,1
4428,as most off you might off seen star wars return off the jedi you may knows its a good movie but as you might have seen on video they mmight have a party at the end and they just probably end the movie with the party with no a spirits or anything but on the original one live tv when they are partying but before i say more when ben obiwan dies in the imperial ship or death star they saw him disappear and yoda dies from either old age or internal illness but because luke killed darth vader real name anakin skywalker when they all are partying at the end when luke or someone stops the spirits off ben and yoda stands starring at him and smiling while another spirit appears is its darth vader but not as a sith as the old usual selve off him and started smiling with ben and yoda i reckon that made the movie ending a little bit interesting but the producers or anyone should off made a spirit off padme and mace windu and other jedis that got killed with younglings under there arms in the back ground,0,1
4454,what can i say i couldnt sleep and i came across this movie on mtv i started watching it with every intention of changing the channel if it started to get lame as so many antidrug movies do but i got sucked into this movie and i couldnt stop watching nick stahl did an amazing job with his character and in my opinion he really made the movie something worth watching i was interested in purchasing the soundtrack to the movie or even the movie itself and mtvcom was no help at all but believe it or not amazoncom is taking preorders for the august 5th release of the movie on dvd i know i had a hard time tracking it down and im sure other people might have had the same problem im buying my own copy so i can drool over nick stahl while bawling my eyes out at the same time thanks to the emotional storyline,0,1
4484,a genuinely creepy ghost story full of chills and sensuality this movie just falls short of what it promises it is apparently based on an old ghost story and perhaps relies a little too much on a simple premise for most of the way its imaginative and genuinely gripping but at the end its almost like oshima just lost interest in it and brought it to a rapid endingthe story is simple a woman and her younger lover kill her husband so that they can be together but their failure of nerve and his returning ghost condemn them to madness its beautifully handled with imaginative set scenes and the lovers passion is portrayed beautifully but too often the movie fails to really deliver on its promise almost as if oshima loses his nerve in the same way the lovers doits a worthwhile movie to watch just to see how oshima combines his great skill as a film maker with some exploitation movie tricks to pull the audience along but sadly its not a true classic in the mold of movies like onibaba or woman of the dunes,0,1
4498,this movie probably had a 750 budget and still managed to surpass titanic i rented this the day i crashed my moms car and it was the only thing that cheered me up beyond belief it has to be tied with the assult of the killer bimbos things to look for are 1 the drive in blow job chinese girl scene 2 the bleach blonde in the sassoon shirt who never changes 3 the flinstonelike screech out driving 4 the clashing ensemble worn by the redhead right before she gets killed dont worry im not ruining any surprises for its soooo predictable 5 the guy who finds it necessary to howl 6 the mental patient who plays a convincing job of being insane by poking out the eyes of a maniquen 7 the hour long chase at the end involving the teacher and the priest 8 the womman writing grafitti on the bathroom wall 9 last but not least the wonderful special effectsespecially the stab in the boob that made a heaven help me popping noiseenjoy,0,1
4525,as i have said before i am not a fan of tweety hes just so aggravating i wish sylvester would just eat him and get it over within this cartoon sly is homeless once again and is back to feeding out of garbage cans he spots a cruise ship leaving port nearby and decides to hop aboard when he spys tweety is one of the passengers the ship provides an adequate stage for the following hijinks and sly desperately tries to catch the annoying bird and avoid seasickness if only for once hes succeed by chewing and swallowing thus finishing of the irritating canary forever but as cartoons starring tweety go this one is quite good but its all thanks to that brilliant cat,0,1
4528,johnny dangerously falls completely in the hit or miss category with its overblown gags and complete lack of a comprehensive script or story that makes any sense but thats the point rightthe cast is likable michael keaton an excellent comic performer before he took himself too seriously as the years passed griffin dunne peter boyle joe piscopo marilu henner and danny devito all perform with enthusiasm and at least get a lot of laughs from me but the complete scene stealer here is richard dimitri sneaking the word iceholes into movie history as a mobster who fares best at murdering the english languagei associate many childhood memories with this film as i watched it quite often so maybe im prone to enjoy it more than many others johnny dangerously is at least a completely innocent gangster film spoof that even relays some well meaning messages about the dangers of smoking and sexi like it but its hard to recommend7 out of 10,0,1
4545,i really am shocked to see the number of reviews that lambaste this movie this movie was not intended to be a deep thought movie which is what the vast majority of the reviewers seem to think it should be in fact it would appear that if any movie doesnt produce a life altering insight and a deep twisted mind boggling plot they would rate it a 1 or 2 dont trash a movie because you dont like the genre peoplethis movie was an actioncomedy flick and thats all it was intended to be and for an actioncomedy it was very well done i was actually rather surprised that i enjoyed it as much as i did having never really been a jamie foxx fan and having the overused plot that it hasthe plot was nothing spectacular using the typical criminal gets out of prison and is thrown into badguy plot while trying to clean up his act see blue streak hudson hawk 48 hours etc etc etc but it was warmed over with a bit of a technological twist now the bad guys are actually the good guys and the real bad guy is an ubergeekjamie foxx actually plays a convincingly humorous while at the same time rather intelligent and serious main character and didnt try to overdo the humor side of the filmif youre looking for a deep underlying plot such as in the matrix or a drama such as of mice and men then this movie isnt for you but if you enjoy the raw action excellent fastpaced filming and an occasional twist of humor tossed in this movie wont disappoint you i would normally have rated it about an 8 on the same level as the die hard trilogy but instead gave it a 10 to try and bring the score up to what it should be,0,1

4623,the true story of a bunch of junkies robbing a not so honest businessman of drugs jewelry guns and money some would say this is the tragic tale of america in the excessive eighties where the high of the peace and free love sixties had crashed into drugs and aids honestly this is just regular people with no aim in life who sit around getting high and decide to rob a ruthless man what is the second part of their master plan once they have his stufftheyll sit around and get high again great plan even if you dont know the story there is no suspense in this movie and no surprises the fact that cox tries to make some kind of folk heroes out of these characters with party scenes and a montage of their loot is weak and insulting the story was better off with a more straight forward approach as it is this is just a sad story of small time drug dealers getting killed by big time drug dealers the bigger story in more ways than one is john holmes he is the center of this story anyway this movie should have been all about him his life he was the one in wonderland with the wonders about to fade awayps although it isnt official boogie nights is a better version of holmes life it isnt entirely factual but its far more enjoyable,0,1
4624,it seems that it is becoming fashionable to rip basic instinct 2 to the point that a significant part of the audience including critics found it terrible even before it was released it seems even more fashionable to trash sharon stone wholike all of usis now fourteen years older andunlike most of usstill looks wonderful first comments on this movie were so vicious that i had to see for myself in my opinion this sequel is not nearly as good as the original film but is not as bad as most comments pretend michael catonjones is not paul verhoeven neither henry bean and leora barish are joe eszterhas basic instinct 2 is just an entertaining average thriller and besides the addition of jerry goldsmith original score keeps little resemblance to its predecessor even stone gives her character a different dimension creating a lustful devilish catherine trimell who can perfectly well rank among other monsters like hannibal lecter she is an intelligent actress who is not afraid of taking risks and can play with camp at her leisure unfortunately she seems to be the main target for those who enjoy trashing this flick she became too successful too much of a main icon and like all those actors who have reached that level her time has arrived and she is now bound to be destroyed by hollywood audiencesthe rest of the cast is outstanding giving performances that are far better than the material deserves david morrissey is a much better actor and by far more interesting than michael douglas his acting is flawless giving a dense complex dimension to an otherwise one dimensional character since he has more screen time and is the axis of the movie he can keep your attention from beginning to endi am not recommending basic instinct 2 as a great movie i am just expressing my disagreement with most of the comments on this site and my conviction that agendas other than the movie itself are shaping the opinion of most spectators,0,1
4629,i followed this entire series when i was a child in grade school by choice not because it was required for school i used to read the plays at the pace of the series the experience gave me a lifelong love for shakespeare and history it even gave me a bit of an acting bug although at an amateur level only whenever i read any of shakespeares history plays the images that come to mind first are from this black and white production seen on a big furniture tv set with a rabbit ear antenna with all the ghosts and wobbles that go with thatalthough the sets were minimal if i remember correctly that was totally irrelevant because the acting was so good at the time i had no idea who any of the actors were now i see that many of them have become well known over the years i particularly enjoyed hotspur and hal whom i now see were played by sean connery and robert hardy i would dearly love to see this available in video especially since many of the plays are seldom performed and even fewer are available on video it would be valuable also as a document of mid20th century televised play production,0,1
4654,i didnt give this movie a perfect score in order to be honest in comparing to great classics like citizen kane and seven samaurai however this movie is so allaround wonderful its a real shame it scores so poorly for the general imdb voter however the imdb voter leans to the geeky and paulie doesnt qualify for thatthe only acting criticism i might suggest is that hallie kate eisenberg didnt portray the perfect stuttering child im sorry but asking a 6 yearold child to outdo dustin hoffman as the rainman is asking for the impossible in filmmakingmoving past that minor complaint the movie has the best of many films buddy roadtrip congames hero as friendly partyanimal partybird disneylike humor for young and old etc whats not to like tony shaloub wears his role like a pair of comfortable jeans thats normal for him it seems im russian i like long stories i dont like mangoes but he almost makes me want to go out and buy one watch the movie and that will make sensebuddy hackett and cheech marin make very appropriate appearances in the film roles that are quite fitting to what we all know about them i have always found jay mohr to be a bit slimy and his onscreen role fits that as well the only surprise to me was finding that jay was also paulies voice in the end even that works well put parrot and antiparrot together as a team and it creates a magic of its ownif you are trying to find a film for you and the kids that is neither insulting nor boring for either paulie is a perfect candidate i will however admit that a happy moment colors my review of paulie i was on a roadtrip during a major heatwave the cars airconditioning died half the restaurants had dead cooling as did our hotel and i said lets watch a movie where there is working airconditioning so we did so for 100 minutes we were cooled amused and given a heartwarming experience when i saw it recently on vcr under less emotional circumstances i realized just how well this movie was madeits a sleeper film you wont regret watching,0,1
4738,i noticed this movie was getting trashed well before it hit the theaters and i too didnt have high hopes for it i figured it was another you got served type of movie with some nice dance moves and horrid acting i was at the theater and deciding between this and meet the spartans and picked this to my surprise the acting wasnt bad at all and the movie was actually pretty good the fact that it has a lower rating than you got served is absolutely ridiculous instead of listening to the garbage posted on here i recommend going to see a matine showing of this movie so you dont spend too much i think you will be pleasantly surprised with how wrong everyone has been about it when it comes to dance movies this is certainly one of the better ones with far superior acting than many of the other ones go see the movie and judge for yourself hopefully the rating will rise after it comes out on dvd and more people check the movie out instead of judging it based on comments before the movie releasededit the movie is now moving closer to its correct rating over 1000 people have given it a rating of 9 a bit too high but at least it is helping to offset the ridiculous votes of 1,0,1
4786,as someone who used to spend hours driving around the backstreets of north london in an attempt to avoid the horrific congestion this film immediately appealed throw in my interest in what london was like back in the late 70s and you have the basic premise for my version of tv heaven on paper the film ticked all the right boxes and having just watched the knowledge the actual movie itself certainly lived up to if not exceeded my high expectationsvisually i was surprised how different london looked back then i lived in islington in the 90s long after gentrification had transformed the area it truly came across as grimy tatty and downatheel london may still have bad housing estates but the general feel of the place is much cleaner brighter and pleasant nowadays based on what this movie shows rather than my own memoriesas for the story and the acting well top marks obviously go to nigel hawthorne as the vampire absolutely brilliant he acts deliberately unpredictably alternating between total straightfaced severity and surreal mindgames in order to unnerve the knowledge boys as he puts them through test after testall in all this was an excellent thoroughly enjoyable trip back into a very specific time and place that i find endlessly fascinating but even if youre not especially interested in london circa 1979 youll still enjoy following the witty dialogue and likable characters of the knowledge,0,1
4789,the main point of the movie imo is the fact the joannas whole life has been nothing but a series of facades the movie opens up with her secretly dying her gray roots and hiding the used kit in an empty tissue box what is strange is that she is hiding this from her husband if she has to hide mundane things from her loved one one can bet that she is hiding even bigger things from others involved in her lifewhen joanna accidentally hits cory she leaves the scene to call the police by the time she returns the police and ambulance are there as well as people from her community remarking what kind of person hits a child then just leaves her there wellrespected in her community she makes the decision to keep quiet about what she had done but she never realized how difficult it would be the keep up her facadesgreat moviei have seen it many times,0,1

4899,without going into any details of a goodif a somewhat provocativetv movie there seems to be a consensus among the users that there is no one to blame herei disagree yes the young male lover of beverly dangelo played by rob estes may be young and horny and good looking because hes not getting as much as he wants from mom that doesnt mean he can climb in bed and have sex with daughter ok he can use the excuse he just wanted to watch tv with her but i dont buy it people have to take responsibility for their actions not only did he cross the line by having sex with a very vulnerable teen when he was supposedly the responsible adulthe said your mom must never know about this how responsible was he then yes its a good flick but he got what was coming to him dont kid yourselves folks that what happened was no ones fault,0,1

4949,i have to admit that i went into fever pitch with low expectations its no huge revelation for me to say that jimmy fallons last movie taxi was catwomanly bad and the trailers for fever pitch were all right but didnt mesmerize me i was already preparing some cheesy baseball puns for my reviewi like jimmy fallon but taxi was strike one in his movie career well now weve got steeeeeeriiiiiike twoooooooo one more strike and its back to snl or buy yourself some peanuts and cracker jacks but dont buy tickets to fever pitch youll walk out of the theater and never go back then the movie had to go and be way more entertaining than i was expecting but hey i couldnt let my puns go to waste right another reason i thought i wouldnt care for the movie is that i hate the boston red sox my whole family hates em the mere mention of pedro martinez name sends me running to the bathroom oh man hold onall right im back anyway my mom who is a st louis cardinals fan still believes the world series was rigged last year she refuses to believe the sox won it legitimately but im man enough to admit that fever pitch caused me to sympathize albeit only slightly with the plight of red sox fansanybody who has a passion for sports will be able to relate to this movie on some level unless you have a favorite sports team you cant fully understand the extreme highs and lows that a fan such as fallons ben can go through theres nothing quite so fresh as the smell of a new season and nothing quite so smooth as a clean slate well figuratively speaking its the joy of being a sports fan wait til next year becomes your mantra your motto your prayer and fever pitch effectively captures that essencei love the fact that the movie takes a fictional story and throws it against the reallife backdrop of the red sox improbable world series run last year i dont love it so much that i want to marry it but you know what i mean i expected this to be handled in a fairly cheesy manner and while some of the humor is a little silly its actually pretty realisticyou see bens uncle took him to his first red sox game when he was 7 years old and when he died he left ben his two season tickets ben hasnt missed a game in 23 years at the beginning of each season he has a draft day where he and his friends get together to figure out who gets to go to which games with him he makes everybody dance for the yankees games and whenever somebody complains he threatens them with tickets for the games with the royals sorry mr shade and the devil rays its a very good scene and it works so well because i actually know of people who do the ticket draft day i also must admit that i can relate to when ben goes to dinner with lindsey and her parents the red sox are playing a road game but instead of watching it live on tv ben decides to tape it one of the most dangerous things in life is taping a game and then being in public and trying to avoid hearing the result been there its a very tense and scary situation weeeeeell ben enters the danger zone when a guy shows up at the restaurant and mentions watching the game ben immediately covers his ears and starts shrieking like a banshee so as not to hear the outcome lindsey is embarrassed and her parents dont know what to think yeah sports fans can be weird i dont deny it but its realnow if youre expecting the crude edgy stuff that the farrelly brothers are known for then you could be disappointed they do have their moments though like when ben says he likes how lindsey sometimes talks out of the side of her mouth like an adorable stroke victim but overall this is definitely a softer more romantic side that the bros are putting on displaythats not to say that the movie ever gets way too sappy thankfully when the sap starts to ooze a bit the farrellys know when to pull away a romantic moment with lindsey jumping on the field and running over to ben to declare her undying love for him turns into ben sincerely replying youve gotta tell me about the outfield is it spongy jimmy fallon proves that with the right material he can handle himself well on the big screen and drew barrymore remains a constant source of romantic comedy charm fever pitch is just good solid entertainment that takes a somewhat fresh look at the romantic comedy genre its a movie that guys and gals can both relate to particularly the guys who practice sports fanaticism at some point during the year and the ladies who must deal with emnow if the red sox fans could please shut up about the curse of the bambino i would appreciate it my memphis tigers have never won the ncaa basketball championship so i officially declare my plight greater than yoursthe gist fans of jimmy fallon drew barrymore romantic comedy the red sox baseball or sports fanaticism in general should consider giving fever pitch a look i wouldnt go out of my way to rush and see it at the first available time but itll make a great matinerating 325 out of 5,0,1

4976,the main problem of the first vampires movie is that none of the characters were sympathetic carpenter learned from his mistake and this time used a likable vampire hunter and a charismatic vampire the female vampire una certainly is the coolest vampire since blades deacon frost unfortunately while there are some good concepts like a cool slow motion restaurant scene why didnt carpenter use more of this this movie is nowhere near as good as it could have been i expected to see strong vampires in action and at least one longer lasting nicely choreographed fight sequence for example inside a city and was left somewhat disappointed while los muertos proceeds at a faster pace than its predecessor it still drags a little in some parts though nowhere near as bad as vampires did much like vampires however this movies climax near the end is not very intensemost of the above may sound like los muertos is a bad movie but it definitely isnt it is generally enjoyable and ranks among the better entries to the genre it is neither an unoriginal dracula remake like almost every other vampire movie out there nor is it an unintelligent action spectacle like blade ii it simply could have used a bit more excitementid really like to see a third installment made by carpenter but its probably not going to happenspoiler warning the ending was way too predictable una should have gotten away that would have made the movie quite unusual,0,1

4989,what exactly do people expect when they watch an al adamson film are they expecting classic cinema that is wonderful beyond belief and will leave them with lasting memories youd think so by some of the reviews al adamsons films are trashy and sleazy and cheesy not much more so if you go into them knowing that already it helps and they arent necessarily to be taken at face value especially when they have so much unintentional entertainment value first off this starts by ripping off the end theme music from outer limits so you know things are looking promising this is the story of some wacko cult that lives in the hills and while trying to raise a dead body the leader suffers a heart attack and ends up in the hospital of course nurse sherri tends to his needs and all and when an operation is needed she just happens to be hanging out in the operating room when the guy passes on so his spirit invades her and nurse sherri begins to change no longer the nice nurse she develops a taste for blood and sharp objects theres a couple little side stories going on like folks trying to burn the body of the dead cult leader and a blinded football star that has become the love object of one of sherris coworkers who also just happens to dabble in voodoo this is not bad if youre a cult film fan but it may be bad if youre a spiderman fan because you wont like it at times this actually lurches towards respectability for adamson anyway but then it unredeems itself with some ridiculous event if you enjoy adamsons films and similar trash you may well like this for anyone else who may be looking for a lost treasure keep digging 7 out of 10,0,1
